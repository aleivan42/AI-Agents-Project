Brazil and Peru have made objections to a bid made by the US online shop for the domain name, \u201c.amazon\u201d.\nAmazon has asked for its company name to be a top-level domain name (currently \u201c.com\u201d), but the South American governments say this would stop the use of this internet address for environmental protection, indigenous rights and other public interest uses.\nThere are many other disputed claims to names, including \u201c.patagonia\u201d.\nUntil now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easy to see in every internet address by the use of \u201c.com\u201d, \u201c.gov\u201d and 20 other categories.\nBut soon there are going to be more of these categories \u2013 or generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known.\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has had bids (each worth almost $200,000) for hundreds of new gTLDs to add to the 22 that we use already.\nAmazon has applied for many new domains, including \u201c.shop\u201d, \u201c.song \u201d, \u201c.book\u201d and \u201c.kindle \u201d. But the one that has caused most discussion is its application for \u201c.amazon\u201d.\nBrazil and Peru want the \u201c.amazon\u201d application to be stopped. They say that a private company should not have a name that is also the name of an important geographical area.\n\u201cAllowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest,\u201d the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.\nBrazil said other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty support its views (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).\nThere have also been other objections over new top-level domains that use geographical or cultural names.\nArgentina is unhappy that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, wants a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty. \u201cArgentina rejects the '.patagonia' request for a new generic top-level domain. Patagonia is an important region for the country\u2019s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources.

The camps, where antisocial families will live for three to six months, have been called \u201cscum villages\u201d because last year Geert Wilders, the far-right politician, said that offenders should go to \u201ca village for scum\u201d.\nBartho Boer, a spokesman for the Mayor, says that the plans are not illiberal. \u201cWe want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want everyone to be who he and she is \u2013 whether they are gay and lesbian or try to stop violence and are then victims of harassment. We want to defend them.\u201d According to Boer, the villages are not for \u201ca problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night\u201d but \u201cpeople who are very violent and in a clear situation where a victim is harassed again and again\u201d.\nPeople found guilty of violent harassment will be evicted from their homes and put in temporary homes, including shipping containers in industrial areas of the city. \u201cWe call it a living container,\u201d says Boer. The containers have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation. They are going to use the containers because they want to show that if people are antisocial they do not get better accommodation.\nOne Dutch newspaper wrote that in the 19th century antisocial people were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which soon became slums. But Boer says that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to put antisocial families together.\nThey are \u201cscum houses\u201d not scum villages, says Boer, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t want to put more than one of these families in the same area\u201d. After a maximum of six months in these houses, in different parts of the city, the families will get permanent homes. The city government expects to move about ten families a year, which starts in 2013.\nPolice will watch the temporary accommodation, but antisocial families will also be able to see doctors and social workers. \u201cWe will take care of them so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in,\u201d says Boer.", "target_complexity_profile": [91.4, 0.534, 0.361, 3.398, 4.684, 1.165, 0.869], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "Strategically dispersed throughout Amsterdam, the city's Mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, has devised an extensive plan to combat escalating antisocial behavior.

Recently the city\u2019s Mayor told them that the coffee shops that sell marijuana would stay open, although there is a new national law to stop drug tourism. But the Dutch capital has a plan to send antisocial neighbours to \u201cscum villages\u201d made from shipping containers, and so maybe now people won\u2019t think it is a liberal city any more.\nThe Mayor, Eberhard van der Laan, says his new plan to solve the problem of antisocial behaviour will cost \u00a3810,000. The plan is hopes to protect victims of abuse and homophobia. The camps, where antisocial families will live for three to six months, have been called \u201cscum villages\u201d because last year Geert Wilders, the far-right politician, said that offenders should go to \u201ca village for scum\u201d.\nBartho Boer, a spokesman for the Mayor, says that the plans are not illiberal. \u201cWe want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want everyone to be who he and she is \u2013 whether they are gay and lesbian or try to stop violence and are then victims of harassment. We want to defend them.\u201d According to Boer, the villages are not for \u201ca problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night\u201d but \u201cpeople who are very violent and in a clear situation where a victim is harassed again and again\u201d.\nPeople found guilty of violent harassment will be evicted from their homes and put in temporary homes, including shipping containers in industrial areas of the city. \u201cWe call it a living container,\u201d says Boer. The containers have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation. They are going to use the containers because they want to show that if people are antisocial they do not get better accommodation.\nOne Dutch newspaper wrote that in the 19th century antisocial people were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which soon became slums. But Boer says that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to put antisocial families together.\nThey are \u201cscum houses\u201d not scum villages, says Boer, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t want to put more than one of these families in the same area\u201d. After a maximum of six months in these houses, in different parts of the city, the families will get permanent homes. The city government expects to move about ten families a year, which starts in 2013.\nPolice will watch the temporary accommodation, but antisocial families will also be able to see doctors and social workers. \u201cWe will take care of them so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in,\u201d says Boer.", "target_complexity_profile": [91.4, 0.534, 0.361, 3.398, 4.684, 1.165, 0.869], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "In an intricate urban tapestry that weaves through Amsterdam, Mayor Eberhard van der Laan has devised a thoughtfully conceived strategy to counteract the escalating issue of antisocial behavior.

A small Google team has flown to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. They have taken their warmest winter clothes, many laptop computers and an 18kg telescopic camera that they can fix to their backpacks.\nThe team spent four days collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on Baffin Island something that people across the world who live in cities now take for granted. An Inuit mapping expert helped the Google team and curious locals followed them around.\nThe town of 7,000 people will go on display via Google\u2019s popular Street View application in July 2013.\nWhen Google made maps of other parts of the world it used a special camera on a car roof. In Iqaluit that was not possible, so Google\u2019s map makers walked the town\u2019s snowy roads and trails. Some roads are made of ice and disappear in the short summer months.\nThe team also walked along part of a 15km road known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about meeting polar bears.\nThe online map that Google had already created using satellite images was mostly correct, but one road was missing that had been built in the last year.\nOne difficulty was how to place on the map many businesses and homes that have mail sent to the local post office and not delivered to their address. Putting the PO box addresses on the map would mean the new map would show all the companies, banks and schools in the same place, around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, business people and high-school pupils helped Google to correct this problem. They were given a laptop computer and told how to make sure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up correctly on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty. Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning, said that people who are thinking of visiting or moving to the area would be able to use the maps to see the area. It may also help planning decisions in Iqaluit happen more quickly.\nThe project leader for Google said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns.

A small Google team has flown to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. They have taken their warmest winter clothes, many laptop computers and an 18kg telescopic camera that they can fix to their backpacks.\nThe team spent four days collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on Baffin Island something that people across the world who live in cities now take for granted.

Putting the PO box addresses on the map would mean the new map would show all the companies, banks and schools in the same place, around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, business people and high-school pupils helped Google to correct this problem. They were given a laptop computer and told how to make sure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up correctly on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty. Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning, said that people who are thinking of visiting or moving to the area would be able to use the maps to see the area. It may also help planning decisions in Iqaluit happen more quickly.\nThe project leader for Google said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns.
