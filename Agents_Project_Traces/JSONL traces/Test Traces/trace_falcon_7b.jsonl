Brazil and Peru have made objections to a bid made by the US online shop for the domain name, \u201c.amazon\u201d.\nAmazon has asked for its company name to be a top-level domain name (currently \u201c.com\u201d), but the South American governments say this would stop the use of this internet address for environmental protection, indigenous rights and other public interest uses.\nThere are many other disputed claims to names, including \u201c.patagonia\u201d.\nUntil now, the differences between commercial, governmental and other types of identity were easy to see in every internet address by the use of \u201c.com\u201d, \u201c.gov\u201d and 20 other categories.\nBut soon there are going to be more of these categories \u2013 or generic top-level domains (gTLDs) as they are technically known.\nThe Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has had bids (each worth almost $200,000) for hundreds of new gTLDs to add to the 22 that we use already.\nAmazon has applied for many new domains, including \u201c.shop\u201d, \u201c.song \u201d, \u201c.book\u201d and \u201c.kindle \u201d. But the one that has caused most discussion is its application for \u201c.amazon\u201d.\nBrazil and Peru want the \u201c.amazon\u201d application to be stopped. They say that a private company should not have a name that is also the name of an important geographical area.\n\u201cAllowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest,\u201d the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.\nBrazil said other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty support its views (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).\nThere have also been other objections over new top-level domains that use geographical or cultural names.\nArgentina is unhappy that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, wants a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty. \u201cArgentina rejects the '.patagonia' request for a new generic top-level domain. Patagonia is an important region for the country\u2019s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources. It is also a major tourist destination.\u201d\nThey will discuss the disputed bids again at a meeting of ICANN\u2019s Governmental Advisory Committee in Durban in July.

They say that a private company should not have a name that is also the name of an important geographical area.\n\u201cAllowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest,\u201d the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.\nBrazil said other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty support its views (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).\nThere have also been other objections over new top-level domains that use geographical or cultural names.\nArgentina is unhappy that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, wants a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty. \u201cArgentina rejects the '.patagonia' request for a new generic top-level domain. Patagonia is an important region for the country\u2019s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources. It is also a major tourist destination.\u201d\nThey will discuss the disputed bids again at a meeting of ICANN\u2019s Governmental Advisory Committee in Durban in July. The first new domain names will probably be in use before the end of 2013.", "target_complexity_profile": [96.971, 0.565, 0.314, 3.658, 3.826, 1.597, 0.885], "complexification_input": {"mode":

The camps, where antisocial families will live for three to six months, have been called \u201cscum villages\u201d because last year Geert Wilders, the far-right politician, said that offenders should go to \u201ca village for scum\u201d.\nBartho Boer, a spokesman for the Mayor, says that the plans are not illiberal. \u201cWe want to defend the liberal values of Amsterdam,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want everyone to be who he and she is \u2013 whether they are gay and lesbian or try to stop violence and are then victims of harassment. We want to defend them.\u201d According to Boer, the villages are not for \u201ca problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night\u201d but \u201cpeople who are very violent and in a clear situation where a victim is harassed again and again\u201d.\nPeople found guilty of violent harassment will be evicted from their homes and put in temporary homes, including shipping containers in industrial areas of the city. \u201cWe call it a living container,\u201d says Boer. The containers have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation. They are going to use the containers because they want to show that if people are antisocial they do not get better accommodation.\nOne Dutch newspaper wrote that in the 19th century antisocial people were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which soon became slums. But Boer says that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to put antisocial families together.\nThey are \u201cscum houses\u201d not scum villages, says Boer, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t want to put more than one of these families in the same area\u201d. After a maximum of six months in these houses, in different parts of the city, the families will get permanent homes. The city government expects to move about ten families a year, which starts in 2013.\nPolice will watch the temporary accommodation, but antisocial families will also be able to see doctors and social workers. \u201cWe will take care of them so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in,\u201d says Boer.", "target_complexity_profile": [91.4, 0.534, 0.361, 3.398, 4.684, 1.165, 0.869], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "- Your task is to rewrite a given source text so that the generated result is more complex in lexicon, syntax, and discourse complexity, according to the guidelines provided in [COMPLEXITY GUIDELINES] and satisfying all the constraints in [TEXT COMPLEXITY PROFILE].\n- When you are given a previous version of your own output in [PREVIOUS TEXT] together with an [ACTION PLAN] produced by the Critic Assistant, you must apply only the specified actions in the plan to rewrite [PREVIOUS TEXT].\n- You must strictly follow the task description, the objectives, the action plan (when given), and the output format specified in the current prompt.

We want to defend them.\u201d According to Boer, the villages are not for \u201ca problem neighbour who has the stereo too loud on Saturday night\u201d but \u201cpeople who are very violent and in a clear situation where a victim is harassed again and again\u201d.\nPeople found guilty of violent harassment will be evicted from their homes and put in temporary homes, including shipping containers in industrial areas of the city. \u201cWe call it a living container,\u201d says Boer. The containers have showers and kitchens and have been used as student accommodation. They are going to use the containers because they want to show that if people are antisocial they do not get better accommodation.\nOne Dutch newspaper wrote that in the 19th century antisocial people were moved to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which soon became slums. But Boer says that the government has learned from past mistakes and is not planning to put antisocial families together.\nThey are \u201cscum houses\u201d not scum villages, says Boer, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t want to put more than one of these families in the same area\u201d. After a maximum of six months in these houses, in different parts of the city, the families will get permanent homes. The city government expects to move about ten families a year, which starts in 2013.\nPolice will watch the temporary accommodation, but antisocial families will also be able to see doctors and social workers. \u201cWe will take care of them so the whole situation is not going to repeat at the new house they are in,\u201d says Boer.", "target_complexity_profile": [91.4, 0.534, 0.361, 3.398, 4.684, 1.165, 0.869], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "- Your task is to generate a rewritten version of the given source text, which is more complex in lexicon, syntax, and discourse complexity, according to the guidelines provided in [COMPLEXITY GUIDELINES] and satisfying all the constraints in [TEXT COMPLEXITY PROFILE].\n- When you are given a previous version of your own output in [PREVIOUS TEXT] together with an [ACTION PLAN] produced by the Critic Assistant, you must apply only the specified actions in the plan to rewrite [PREVIOUS TEXT].\n- You must strictly follow the task description, the objectives, the action plan (when given), and the output format specified in the current prompt.

Its estimated price is up to $800,000.\nPoundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of its shop.\nBanksy himself has not commented on the sale of Slave Labour, but he has condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork in the past.\nStephan Keszler, the dealer at a 2011 auction in New York that also planned to sell Banky\u2019s paintings, believes selling Banksy\u2019s works without his permission is fair.\n\u201cHe does something on other people\u2019s walls and houses without asking.

It\u2019s a real victory for the people.\u201d said Alan Strickland, a Haringey councillor.\nThe auction house said it had told the owners of the two Banksys that they should remove them from the sale. \u201cThere are no legal problems with the sale of the artwork by Banksy, but FAAM told its sellers they should remove them from the auction.\u201d\nCritics have said the auction house was buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller was the real owner and that the sale was legal.\nHe added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the UK, but said he thought it was right to sell the two pieces of artwork because it would keep them safe.\nThe second Banksy that was going to be auctioned was a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall. Its estimated price is up to $800,000.\nPoundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of its shop.\nBanksy himself has not commented on the sale of Slave Labour, but he has condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork in the past.\nStephan Keszler, the dealer at a 2011 auction in New York that also planned to sell Banky\u2019s paintings, believes selling Banksy\u2019s works without his permission is fair.\n\u201cHe does something on other people\u2019s walls and houses without asking. The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,\u201d Keszler said.", "target_complexity_profile": [78.5, 0.494, 0.296, 3.488, 5.167, 1.923, 0.883], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "The text is also long and contains a lot of information.

The expected price was about $700,000. It was going to be in a sale of street art in Florida.\nBut Frederic Thut, the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house said that Slave Labour and a second work by the secretive British street artist were removed from sale at the auction. He did not want to give the name of the seller.\nPeople in Haringey, London, were very happy, because they led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey.\n\u201cI will write to the auction house to find out what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that a people\u2019s campaign in London has had an impact in the US. It\u2019s a real victory for the people.\u201d said Alan Strickland, a Haringey councillor.\nThe auction house said it had told the owners of the two Banksys that they should remove them from the sale. \u201cThere are no legal problems with the sale of the artwork by Banksy, but FAAM told its sellers they should remove them from the auction.\u201d\nCritics have said the auction house was buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller was the real owner and that the sale was legal.\nHe added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the UK, but said he thought it was right to sell the two pieces of artwork because it would keep them safe.\nThe second Banksy that was going to be auctioned was a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall. Its estimated price is up to $800,000.\nPoundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of its shop.\nBanksy himself has not commented on the sale of Slave Labour, but he has condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork in the past.\nStephan Keszler, the dealer at a 2011 auction in New York that also planned to sell Banky\u2019s paintings, believes selling Banksy\u2019s works without his permission is fair.\n\u201cHe does something on other people\u2019s walls and houses without asking. The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,\u201d Keszler said.", "target_complexity_profile": [78.5, 0.494, 0.296, 3.488, 5.167, 1.923, 0.883], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "The text is also long and contains a lot of information.

The expected price was about $700,000. It was going to be in a sale of street art in Florida.\nBut Frederic Thut, the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house said that Slave Labour and a second work by the secretive British street artist were removed from sale at the auction. He did not want to give the name of the seller.\nPeople in Haringey, London, were very happy, because they led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey.\n\u201cI will write to the auction house to find out what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that a people\u2019s campaign in London has had an impact in the US. It\u2019s a real victory for the people.\u201d said Alan Strickland, a Haringey councillor.\nThe auction house said it had told the owners of the two Banksys that they should remove them from the sale. \u201cThere are no legal problems with the sale of the artwork by Banksy, but FAAM told its sellers they should remove them from the auction.\u201d\nCritics have said the auction house was buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller was the real owner and that the sale was legal.\nHe added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the UK, but said he thought it was right to sell the two pieces of artwork because it would keep them safe.\nThe second Banksy that was going to be auctioned was a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall. Its estimated price is up to $800,000.\nPoundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of its shop.\nBanksy himself has not commented on the sale of Slave Labour, but he has condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork in the past.\nStephan Keszler, the dealer at a 2011 auction in New York that also planned to sell Banky\u2019s paintings, believes selling Banksy\u2019s works without his permission is fair.\n\u201cHe does something on other people\u2019s walls and houses without asking. The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,\u201d Keszler said.", "target_complexity_profile": [78.5, 0.494, 0.296, 3.488, 5.167, 1.923, 0.883], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "The text is also long and contains a lot of information.

The expected price was about $700,000. It was going to be in a sale of street art in Florida.\nBut Frederic Thut, the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house said that Slave Labour and a second work by the secretive British street artist were removed from sale at the auction. He did not want to give the name of the seller.\nPeople in Haringey, London, were very happy, because they led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey.\n\u201cI will write to the auction house to find out what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that a people\u2019s campaign in London has had an impact in the US. It\u2019s a real victory for the people.\u201d said Alan Strickland, a Haringey councillor.\nThe auction house said it had told the owners of the two Banksys that they should remove them from the sale. \u201cThere are no legal problems with the sale of the artwork by Banksy, but FAAM told its sellers they should remove them from the auction.\u201d\nCritics have said the auction house was buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller was the real owner and that the sale was legal.\nHe added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the UK, but said he thought it was right to sell the two pieces of artwork because it would keep them safe.\nThe second Banksy that was going to be auctioned was a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall. Its estimated price is up to $800,000.\nPoundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of its shop.\nBanksy himself has not commented on the sale of Slave Labour, but he has condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork in the past.\nStephan Keszler, the dealer at a 2011 auction in New York that also planned to sell Banky\u2019s paintings, believes selling Banksy\u2019s works without his permission is fair.\n\u201cHe does something on other people\u2019s walls and houses without asking. The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,\u201d Keszler said.", "target_complexity_profile": [78.5, 0.494, 0.296, 3.488, 5.167, 1.923, 0.883], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "The text is also long and contains a lot of information.

The expected price was about $700,000. It was going to be in a sale of street art in Florida.\nBut Frederic Thut, the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house said that Slave Labour and a second work by the secretive British street artist were removed from sale at the auction. He did not want to give the name of the seller.\nPeople in Haringey, London, were very happy, because they led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey.\n\u201cI will write to the auction house to find out what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that a people\u2019s campaign in London has had an impact in the US. It\u2019s a real victory for the people.\u201d said Alan Strickland, a Haringey councillor.\nThe auction house said it had told the owners of the two Banksys that they should remove them from the sale. \u201cThere are no legal problems with the sale of the artwork by Banksy, but FAAM told its sellers they should remove them from the auction.\u201d\nCritics have said the auction house was buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller was the real owner and that the sale was legal.\nHe added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the UK, but said he thought it was right to sell the two pieces of artwork because it would keep them safe.\nThe second Banksy that was going to be auctioned was a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall. Its estimated price is up to $800,000.\nPoundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of its shop.\nBanksy himself has not commented on the sale of Slave Labour, but he has condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork in the past.\nStephan Keszler, the dealer at a 2011 auction in New York that also planned to sell Banky\u2019s paintings, believes selling Banksy\u2019s works without his permission is fair.\n\u201cHe does something on other people\u2019s walls and houses without asking. The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,\u201d Keszler said.", "target_complexity_profile": [78.5, 0.494, 0.296, 3.488, 5.167, 1.923, 0.883], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "The text is also long and contains a lot of information.

The expected price was about $700,000. It was going to be in a sale of street art in Florida.\nBut Frederic Thut, the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house said that Slave Labour and a second work by the secretive British street artist were removed from sale at the auction. He did not want to give the name of the seller.\nPeople in Haringey, London, were very happy, because they led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey.\n\u201cI will write to the auction house to find out what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that a people\u2019s campaign in London has had an impact in the US. It\u2019s a real victory for the people.\u201d said Alan Strickland, a Haringey councillor.\nThe auction house said it had told the owners of the two Banksys that they should remove them from the sale. \u201cThere are no legal problems with the sale of the artwork by Banksy, but FAAM told its sellers they should remove them from the auction.\u201d\nCritics have said the auction house was buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller was the real owner and that the sale was legal.\nHe added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the UK, but said he thought it was right to sell the two pieces of artwork because it would keep them safe.\nThe second Banksy that was going to be auctioned was a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall. Its estimated price is up to $800,000.\nPoundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of its shop.\nBanksy himself has not commented on the sale of Slave Labour, but he has condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork in the past.\nStephan Keszler, the dealer at a 2011 auction in New York that also planned to sell Banky\u2019s paintings, believes selling Banksy\u2019s works without his permission is fair.\n\u201cHe does something on other people\u2019s walls and houses without asking. The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,\u201d Keszler said.", "target_complexity_profile": [78.5, 0.494, 0.296, 3.488, 5.167, 1.923, 0.883], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "The text is also long and contains a lot of information.

The expected price was about $700,000. It was going to be in a sale of street art in Florida.\nBut Frederic Thut, the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house said that Slave Labour and a second work by the secretive British street artist were removed from sale at the auction. He did not want to give the name of the seller.\nPeople in Haringey, London, were very happy, because they led a campaign to stop the sale of the artwork that was removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in Haringey.\n\u201cI will write to the auction house to find out what will happen next, but for now we are really pleased that a people\u2019s campaign in London has had an impact in the US. It\u2019s a real victory for the people.\u201d said Alan Strickland, a Haringey councillor.\nThe auction house said it had told the owners of the two Banksys that they should remove them from the sale. \u201cThere are no legal problems with the sale of the artwork by Banksy, but FAAM told its sellers they should remove them from the auction.\u201d\nCritics have said the auction house was buying and selling stolen property but Thut said that the seller was the real owner and that the sale was legal.\nHe added that his gallery had received many emails and phone calls from the UK, but said he thought it was right to sell the two pieces of artwork because it would keep them safe.\nThe second Banksy that was going to be auctioned was a 2007 artwork called Wet Dog that was removed from a Bethlehem wall. Its estimated price is up to $800,000.\nPoundland said it had no idea who removed the 4ft x 5ft mural from the side of its shop.\nBanksy himself has not commented on the sale of Slave Labour, but he has condemned people who have tried to sell his artwork in the past.\nStephan Keszler, the dealer at a 2011 auction in New York that also planned to sell Banky\u2019s paintings, believes selling Banksy\u2019s works without his permission is fair.\n\u201cHe does something on other people\u2019s walls and houses without asking. The owner of the property can do whatever they want with it,\u201d Keszler said.", "target_complexity_profile": [78.5, 0.494, 0.296, 3.488, 5.167, 1.923, 0.883], "complexification_input": {"mode": "refinement", "previous_text": "The text is also long and contains a lot of information.
