The local administration, under Mayor Eberhard van der Laan, has unveiled an ambitious policy aimed at addressing antisocial behavior through the establishment of rehousing camps, colloquially referred to as \"scum villages,\" constructed from repurposed shipping containers. This controversial measure is intended to protect victims of abuse and homophobia by relocating problematic families for a period ranging from three to six months.\n\nVan der Laan asserts that these measures are not at odds with Amsterdam's liberal values, emphasizing the city\u2019s commitment to safeguarding individuals who face harassment or violence.

Boer maintains that the government has learned from historical precedents, where 19th-century troublemakers were relocated to villages that quickly deteriorated into slums. However, he assures that the current plan does not intend to house multiple families together.\n\nThe policy is expected to impact approximately ten families annually, with a duration of six months in different parts of the city before permanent housing is secured.

Bolivia has received a special exemption from the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which controls international drugs policy. The exemption allows Bolivias indigenous people to chew the leaves.\nBolivia had argued that the convention was in 2 opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which says it must protect native and ancestral coca as part of its cultural heritage and maintains that coca in its natural state  is not a narcotic.\nSouth American Indians have chewed coca 3 leaves for centuries. The leaves are said to provide energy and have medicinal qualities. Supporters of Bolivias position said that defending the rights of indigenous people was the right thing to do. The Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking, said Danny Kushlick, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which supports drug liberalization.

Bolivia has obtained a special exemption from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the framework that governs international drugs policy, allowing its indigenous people to chew the leaves.\nBolivia had argued that the convention was in opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which obliges it to \u201cprotect native and ancestral coca as cultural patrimony\u201d and maintains that coca \u201cin its natural state \u2026 is not a narcotic\u201d.\nSouth American Indians have chewed coca leaves for centuries. The leaves reputedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities. Supporters of Bolivia\u2019s position praised it for standing up for the rights of indigenous people. \u201cThe Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking,\u201d said Danny Kushlick, Head of External Affairs at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which promotes drug liberalization. \u201cIt shows that any country that has had enough of the war on drugs can change the terms of its engagement with the UN conventions.\u201d\nHowever, the UN\u2019s International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties, has accused Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime. A number of countries \u2013 including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia \u2013 opposed Bolivia\u2019s demands.\nThe UK\u2019s submission to the UN, which oversees the convention, said that it \u201cacknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia\u201d, but it adds: \u201cThe United Kingdom is \u2026 concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and \u2013 crucially \u2013 the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. As such, the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the drugs trade and could weaken the international community\u2019s response to that trade.\u201d\nThe right of indigenous communities in South America\u2019s Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention. But, under the terms of the agreement, Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban. This expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute.\nIn 2011, Bolivia \u2013 whose President, Evo Morales, is a former coca producer \u2013 formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the convention. On Friday it reacceded to the convention, but with an exemption from the prohibition on the chewing of coca leaves.\nThe move is the first of its kind in the history of UN drug-control treaties and has sparked concerns that other countries may apply for amendments. The Russian government has argued that the move will lead to \u201can increase in illegal circulation of cocaine\u201d and warned that \u201cit also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime\u201d.\nThe British parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Select Committee has recommended that Bolivia\u2019s request should be backed by the UK government, arguing that it was important that countries remained within the single convention. Bolivia\u2019s re-accession could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request. There are suspicions that the US and UK are frantically lobbying other countries to gain sufficient numbers to block Bolivia\u2019s request.\nNancie Prud\u2019homme, Projects Director at the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivia\u2019s demands. \u201cThese objections are legally questionable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey support an arbitrary and over-broad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum. This is not appropriate.

In an interview in 1949, the head of the Commission, Howard B Fonda, signalled his opposition to the chewing of coca leaves before his inquiry had begun. Fonda told an interviewer: \u201cWe believe that the daily, inveterate use of coca leaves by chewing \u2026 is not only thoroughly noxious and therefore detrimental, but is also the cause of racial degeneration in many centres of population, and of the decadence that visibly shows in numerous Indians \u2026 Our studies will confirm the certainty of our assertions and we hope we can present a rational plan of action \u2026 to attain the absolute and sure abolition of this pernicious habit.\u201d\nThe growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia.

During the Bolivian dictatorship in 1964, when Bolivia acceded to the convention, a temporary ban introduced that year, which lasted until 1989, was enacted with a 25-year grace period that expired in 1989. This evolving situation led to ongoing disputes and eventually prompted President Evo Morales, formerly a coca producer, to formally notify the UN of Bolivia's intention to withdraw from the convention but later rejoined it with an exemption clause allowing indigenous people to continue their traditional practice.\n\nGiven these concerns and debates, international organizations and governments are now engaging in discussions about a more balanced approach. The United Nations' International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), responsible for monitoring global drug treaties, warned that Bolivia's exemption could jeopardize international drug control efforts.

The major demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro, the bustling metropolis, S\u00e3o Paulo, Bras\u00edlia, Bel\u00e9m, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, and other cities commenced peacefully; however, several incidents escalated into confrontations between protesters and police, resulting in arson attacks on vehicles and public transportation.\n\nDuring previous protests against bus fare hikes, participants had reported that law enforcement responded disproportionately with rubber bullets, tear gas, and violent physical assaults. These recent rallies coincided with the commencement of the football Confederations Cup, bringing together individuals who are aggrieved by escalating costs and deteriorating quality of public services, substantial expenditures on international sporting events, substandard healthcare standards, and broader concerns over inequality and corruption.\n\nWhile the majority of demonstrations remained peaceful, several instances of unrest emerged. A large crowd in Rio de Janeiro set fires outside a government office, smashed windows, and spray-painted slogans such as \"Revolution,\" \"Down with Paes,\" \"Down with Cabral\" (the mayor and state governor), and \"Hate police.\" Inside the building, officers responded with pepper spray.\n\nThe reasons for these protests varied widely. \"We are here because we hate the government; they do nothing for us,\" stated Oscar Jos\u00e9 Santos, a 19-year-old individual. \"I am an architect but have been unemployed for six months.

In an article for Index on Censorship, Pullman, who is president of the Society of Authors, strongly defends copyright laws. He criticizes internet users who think it is OK to download music or books without paying for them.\nThe technical brilliance is so dazzling that people cant see the moral squalor of what theyre doing, he writes. It is outrageous that anyone can steal an artists work and get away with it. It is theft, just as putting your hand in someones pocket and taking their wallet is theft.\nHis article comes after music industry leaders met British Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street to discuss the issue of web piracy.\nPullman, writer of the His Dark Materials trilogy, says authors and musicians work in poverty and obscurity for years to bring their work to the level that gives delight to their audiences and, as soon as they achieve that, the possibility of earning a living from it is taken away from them. He concludes: The principle is simple, and unaltered by technology, science or magic: if we want to enjoy the work that someone does, we should pay for it.\nPullman is writing in the next issue of the campaign groups magazine in a dialogue with Cathy Casserly, chief executive of Creative Commons, which offers open content licences that lets creators take copyright into their own hands. Casserly argues that there is a lot wrong with copyright, which was created in an analogue age. She writes: Copyright closes the door on the many ways that people can share, build upon and remix each others work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were made. She says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and earn money from their work, quoting the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who said: My problem is not piracy, its obscurity.\nIndex on Censorship agrees.

Casserly argues that there is much wrong with copyright, which was created \u201cin an analogue age\u201d. She writes: \u201cBy default, copyright closes the door on countless ways that people can share, build upon and remix each other\u2019s work, possibilities that were unimaginable when those laws were established.\u201d\nShe says artists need to think creatively about how they distribute and monetize their work, quoting the science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who said: \u201cMy problem is not piracy, it\u2019s obscurity.\u201d\nIndex on Censorship agrees. The magazine\u2019s editor, Rachael Jolley, said: \u201cExisting copyright laws don\u2019t work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers. We need new models for how artists, writers and musicians earn a living from their work.\u201d\nThe debate is a lively one and the scale of illegal downloading vast. Data collected by Ofcom (the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries) suggests that, between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated, along with 52 million TV shows, 29 million films, 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files.\nOfcom has said 18% of internet users aged over 12 admit to having recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught. Pullman writes in his article: \u201cThe ease and swiftness with which music can be acquired in the form of MP3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our iTunes list for some time.\u201d\nOne thing to emerge from the Downing Street meeting was Cameron\u2019s appointment of the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley to be his adviser on the subject. A spokesman for the BPI, the record industry trade body, said: \u201cMike Weatherley is a strong champion of copyright and the artists and creative producers it\u2019s there to protect. We hope his influence and the prime minister\u2019s endorsement of copyright will be brought to bear on the approach of the UK\u2019s intellectual property office.\u201d", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The ethical ramifications of digital piracy are profound and analogous to traditional theft, contends author Philip Pullman. In his op-ed for Index on Censorship, Pullman, who serves as president of the Society of Authors, fervently advocates for robust copyright protections. He lambasts netizens who believe it is permissible to download music or books without remuneration.\n\nThe dazzling technical prowess of the internet often obscures the moral degradation inherent in such actions, he posits. It is unjustifiable that anyone can appropriate an artist's work and escape accountability; this act is equivalent to robbery, as physically stealing a wallet from someone\u2019s pocket would be.\n\nFurthermore, his commentary follows discussions between music industry leaders and British Prime Minister David Cameron at Downing Street regarding the issue of web piracy. Following these discussions, Pullman's article appears alongside a dialogue with Cathy Casserly, chief executive of Creative Commons, who provides open content licenses enabling creators to manage their copyrights. Casserly argues that copyright laws, crafted in an analog era, stifle the myriad ways people can share, build upon, and remix each other\u2019s work\u2014possibilities unimaginable at the time these statutes were enacted.\n\nShe posits that artists must creatively rethink how they distribute and monetize their creations, citing science fiction author Cory Doctorow who stated: \"My issue is not piracy but obscurity.\" Index on Censorship concurs, with editor Rachael Jolley asserting that existing copyright laws are ineffective in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers.
