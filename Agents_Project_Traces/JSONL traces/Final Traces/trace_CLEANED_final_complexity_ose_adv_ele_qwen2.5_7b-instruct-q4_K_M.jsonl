A small Google team has flown to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. They have taken their warmest winter clothes, many laptop computers and an 18kg telescopic camera that they can fix to their backpacks.\nThe team spent four days collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on Baffin Island something that people across the world who live in cities now take for granted.

Putting the PO box addresses on the map would mean the new map would show all the companies, banks and schools in the same place, around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, business people and high-school pupils helped Google to correct this problem. They were given a laptop computer and told how to make sure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up correctly on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty. Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning, said that people who are thinking of visiting or moving to the area would be able to use the maps to see the area. It may also help planning decisions in Iqaluit happen more quickly.\nThe project leader for Google said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns. But moving people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory is very expensive. So, in the future, Google might send equipment to the area and ask volunteers to complete the map.", "human_reference": "\ufeffIt has charted the world\u2019s highest peaks, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest and even provided a glimpse into North Korea. But Google\u2019s mission to map the world has largely steered clear of the inhospitable Arctic.\nNow, however, the search-engine firm is embarking on what might be the most significant update to centuries of polar cartography \u2013 and one it hopes will help provide a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users. Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpack- mounted telescopic camera.\nHelped by an Inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of Baffin Island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.\nThe town of 7,000 people will go on display via Google\u2019s popular Street View application in July 2013.\nAaron Brindle, project leader, said: \u201cI live in Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn\u2019t been the case in the north.\u201d\nUnlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town\u2019s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.\nThe team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.\nMayor John Graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers.\nGraham understands the enthusiasm. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.\nAnother difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit\u2019s growth.\nThe test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.\nThe gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why Google selected the less- hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.\nBrindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Google\u2019s ambitions.\nThe next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that three, four, five years from now we\u2019ll look back and see a very different map of Canada\u2019s north,\u201d Brindle added.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "Google has undertaken an ambitious endeavor to create comprehensive maps of the world's highest mountains, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest, and even ventured into North Korea, all while maintaining a commitment to mapping the entire globe. However, they have largely refrained from exploring the Arctic regions until now.\n\nIn this significant update to polar cartography, Google aims to enhance understanding of life in permafrost areas for millions of users worldwide. A dedicated team has recently embarked on an expedition to Iqaluit, the largest settlement within Nunavut's territory, where they have donned their warmest winter attire and equipped themselves with multiple laptop computers and a 18 kg telescopic camera designed for backpacking.\n\nOver four days, this group meticulously collected images and data that will provide residents of Baffin Island\u2019s isolated community with the same level of digital street view access enjoyed by city dwellers. An Inuit mapping specialist assisted in their efforts, while local inhabitants observed their activities curiously.\n\nThe town's 7,000 inhabitants are set to be featured prominently on Google\u2019s Street View application, which will debut in July 2013. Unlike previous mapping projects where a specialized camera was mounted atop a vehicle, the team had to walk Iqaluit\u2019s snowy streets and trails due to logistical constraints.\n\nAmong their challenges was navigating the Road to Nowhere, a 15 km stretch notorious for its dangers, including encounters with polar bears.

As a first step, world leaders should formally commit themselves to reducing inequality to the levels seen in 1990.\u201d\nShe said closing tax havens, which the Tax Justice Network says hold as much as $31 trillion, or as much as a third of all global wealth, could yield $189bn in additional tax revenues.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The substantial accumulations of immense fortunes by the world's most affluent 100 billionaires are exacerbating global inequality and impeding efforts to alleviate poverty, according to Oxfam's findings. Specifically, these ultra-wealthy individuals generate their earnings through a variety of means, including investments in technology, real estate, and other sectors, which contribute significantly to this disparity.\n\nOxfam asserts that the $240 billion generated by the top 100 billionaires in 2012 would be sufficient to reduce global poverty by a factor of four. Typically, charities refrain from criticizing the wealthy, as they are often perceived as a source of financial support; however, notable exceptions include Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have pledged significant portions of their wealth to philanthropic endeavors. Nonetheless, detailed annual contributions remain scarce.\n\nAccording to Oxfam's report, Russian, Middle Eastern, and Chinese billionaires exhibit distinct patterns of charitable giving that differ from those seen in their American counterparts. The organization posits that the wealthiest 1% has witnessed a 60% increase in income over the past two decades. In the United Kingdom, income disparities have reached levels not observed since the 19th century, with the top 10% now commanding nearly 60% of total earnings. Similarly, in China, the top 10% now command nearly 60% of total earnings, mirroring South African inequality levels, which are currently the highest globally.\n\nIn the United States, the share of national income accruing to the top 1% has doubled from 10% to 20% since 1980. As reported by Oxfam's findings, Barbara Stocking, Oxfam\u2019s Chief Executive, further emphasized that it is no longer tenable to assume that wealth concentrated among a few will benefit the majority; often, it perpetuates socioeconomic deprivation.\n\nFurthermore, as highlighted by Oxfam's report, global inequality manifests differently across regions. In the United Kingdom, income disparities have reached levels not observed since the 19th century, with the top 10% now commanding nearly 60% of total earnings, a figure that mirrors South African inequality levels, which are currently the highest globally. Similarly, in China, the top 10% now command nearly 60% of total earnings.\n\nIn Brazil, the report advocates for learning from countries that have experienced rapid economic growth while simultaneously reducing inequality. Specifically, as highlighted by Oxfam's findings, Barbara Stocking proposes that world leaders should aim to reduce inequality to levels observed in 1990 and suggests closing tax havens, which hold approximately $31 trillion or one-third of global wealth, could yield an additional $189 billion in taxes.", "rewritten_text_profile": [97.055, 0.564, 1.0, 3.34, 4.75, 1.081, 0.861]}, "critic_output": {"status": "revision required", "action_plan": [{"id": 1, "instruction": "Increase complexity."}]}}

But two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug. As demand for BlackBerry handsets fades, the once noisy BBM grapevine is falling silent. Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s own-brand instant messaging applications to independent start-ups such as WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian).

Many countries \u2013 including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia \u2013 do not want to give Bolivia what it is asking for.\nThe UK told the UN that it \u201crespects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia\u201d, but it adds: \u201cThe United Kingdom is worried that the exemption could lead to more coca production and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 more coca reaching the cocaine trade. The exemption would make it more difficult to control the illegal drugs trade.\u201d\nThe right of indigenous people in South America\u2019s Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed the convention.\nIn 2011, Bolivia told the UN that it did not want to be part of the convention any more. It is now part of the convention again, but with an exemption so that its indigenous people can continue chewing coca leaves.\nThe exemption is the first in the history of UN drug-control agreements. It has led to worries that other countries may also ask for exemptions. The Russian government says that the exemption will lead to more illegal cocaine and warns that \u201cit also sets a dangerous example that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime\u201d.\nThe British parliament has recommended that the UK government should support Bolivia\u2019s request. It says that it is important that countries stay in the convention.

Bolivia has obtained a special exemption from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the framework that governs international drugs policy, allowing its indigenous people to chew the leaves.\nBolivia had argued that the convention was in opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which obliges it to \u201cprotect native and ancestral coca as cultural patrimony\u201d and maintains that coca \u201cin its natural state \u2026 is not a narcotic\u201d.\nSouth American Indians have chewed coca leaves for centuries. The leaves reputedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities. Supporters of Bolivia\u2019s position praised it for standing up for the rights of indigenous people. \u201cThe Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking,\u201d said Danny Kushlick, Head of External Affairs at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which promotes drug liberalization. \u201cIt shows that any country that has had enough of the war on drugs can change the terms of its engagement with the UN conventions.\u201d\nHowever, the UN\u2019s International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties, has accused Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime. A number of countries \u2013 including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia \u2013 opposed Bolivia\u2019s demands.\nThe UK\u2019s submission to the UN, which oversees the convention, said that it \u201cacknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia\u201d, but it adds: \u201cThe United Kingdom is \u2026 concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and \u2013 crucially \u2013 the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. As such, the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the drugs trade and could weaken the international community\u2019s response to that trade.\u201d\nThe right of indigenous communities in South America\u2019s Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention. But, under the terms of the agreement, Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban. This expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute.\nIn 2011, Bolivia \u2013 whose President, Evo Morales, is a former coca producer \u2013 formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the convention. On Friday it reacceded to the convention, but with an exemption from the prohibition on the chewing of coca leaves.\nThe move is the first of its kind in the history of UN drug-control treaties and has sparked concerns that other countries may apply for amendments. The Russian government has argued that the move will lead to \u201can increase in illegal circulation of cocaine\u201d and warned that \u201cit also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime\u201d.\nThe British parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Select Committee has recommended that Bolivia\u2019s request should be backed by the UK government, arguing that it was important that countries remained within the single convention. Bolivia\u2019s re-accession could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request. There are suspicions that the US and UK are frantically lobbying other countries to gain sufficient numbers to block Bolivia\u2019s request.\nNancie Prud\u2019homme, Projects Director at the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivia\u2019s demands. \u201cThese objections are legally questionable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey support an arbitrary and over-broad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum. This is not appropriate. No state has paid any attention to decades of developing international norms on cultural and indigenous rights, which support Bolivia\u2019s efforts.\u201d\nThe decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report produced by the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf, which proponents of drug liberalization say was not based on supporting evidence. In an interview in 1949, the head of the Commission, Howard B Fonda, signalled his opposition to the chewing of coca leaves before his inquiry had begun. Fonda told an interviewer: \u201cWe believe that the daily, inveterate use of coca leaves by chewing \u2026 is not only thoroughly noxious and therefore detrimental, but is also the cause of racial degeneration in many centres of population, and of the decadence that visibly shows in numerous Indians \u2026 Our studies will confirm the certainty of our assertions and we hope we can present a rational plan of action \u2026 to attain the absolute and sure abolition of this pernicious habit.\u201d\nThe growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia. The policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country, leading some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "A significant international dispute has emerged regarding the legal entitlement of Bolivia's indigenous communities to consume coca leaves, which are the primary component of cocaine. This disagreement could substantially influence global drug policy frameworks. Bolivia holds a unique status under the 1961 Convention on Drugs, an agreement that governs international narcotics control, due to its special exemption allowing the use of coca leaves by its indigenous populace.\n\nAccording to Bolivia's constitution, it is imperative to safeguard native and ancestral coca practices as integral parts of cultural heritage. The document explicitly states that in its natural state, coca does not pose a hazardous threat. For centuries, South American Indians have utilized coca leaves for their energizing effects and medicinal properties. Advocates supporting Bolivia\u2019s stance argue that upholding the rights of indigenous peoples is ethically justifiable.\n\nHowever, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which oversees global drug accords, contends that granting such an exemption might undermine international drug control efforts. Numerous nations, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Russia, oppose Bolivia's request for this special dispensation.\n\nThe UK has expressed its concern over potential adverse effects, emphasizing that while it acknowledges the cultural significance of coca in Bolivia, it fears that such an exemption could exacerbate illicit drug trafficking. The historical context reveals that the right to chew coca leaves was rescinded in 1964 during a period of Bolivian dictatorship and subsequent ratification of the convention.\n\nIn 2011, Bolivia formally withdrew from the convention but later rejoined with a stipulation permitting its indigenous communities to continue using coca. This exemption represents an unprecedented precedent within UN drug-control agreements, sparking apprehensions that other nations might seek similar accommodations. The Russian government has warned that such exemptions could facilitate increased illegal cocaine production and undermine global drug control regimes.\n\nThe British Parliament has recommended supporting Bolivia's request, asserting the importance of maintaining membership in the convention.

The policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country, leading some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "A notable international controversy has emerged regarding the legal status of coca leaf consumption by Bolivia\u2019s native inhabitants, a practice that holds profound heritage value for South America\u2019s ancestral peoples. This disagreement could significantly impact global drug policy frameworks. Bolivia enjoys a unique position under the 1961 Convention on Drugs, an agreement that governs international narcotics control, due to its special exemption allowing the use of coca leaves by its indigenous populace.\n\nAccording to Bolivia\u2019s constitution, it is imperative to protect native and ancestral coca practices as integral components of cultural heritage. The document explicitly states that in its natural state, coca does not pose a hazardous threat. For decades, the Bolivian people have relied on coca leaves for their energizing effects and medicinal properties, which are well-documented in traditional healing practices.\n\nAdvocates supporting Bolivia\u2019s stance argue that upholding the rights of indigenous communities is ethically justifiable. However, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which oversees global drug accords, contends that granting such an exemption might undermine international drug control efforts. Numerous nations, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Russia, oppose Bolivia\u2019s request for this special dispensation.\n\nFor generations, the Bolivian people have utilized coca leaves not only for their energizing effects but also as a medicinal resource, practices that are deeply rooted in traditional healing rituals. The UK has expressed its concern over potential adverse effects, emphasizing that while it acknowledges the traditional importance of coca in Bolivia, it fears that such an exemption could exacerbate illicit drug trafficking.\n\nDespite these concerns, the UK has expressed its support for Bolivia\u2019s request, asserting the importance of maintaining membership in the convention. However, the decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report that some critics argue lacked scientific validation and moral imperatives. Despite this, it remains legally permissible for Bolivians to cultivate coca leaves, which has led to a reduction in cocaine production and positions Bolivia as an exemplary nation for others considering similar policies.\n\nOn the other hand, Nancie Prud\u2019homme of the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy argues that opposition to Bolivia\u2019s request is unjustified from a legal standpoint. For decades, she contends, global trends increasingly support cultural and indigenous rights, thereby justifying Bolivia's efforts based on scientific validation and moral imperatives.", "rewritten_text_profile": [105.514, 0.626, 1.0, 3.361, 3.75, 1.207, 0.861]}, "critic_output": {"status": "revision required", "action_plan": [{"id": 1, "type": "lexical", "target_metrics": ["MTLD", "LD"], "location": "paragraph 2, sentences 3-4", "instruction": "Replace the repeated phrase 'traditional healing practices' with more varied expressions such as 'time-honored remedies', 'ancestral cures', and 'indigenous medical traditions'."}, {"id": 2, "type": "syntactic", "target_metrics": ["MDD", "CS"], "location": "paragraph 3, sentences 1-2", "instruction": "Rearrange the sentence structure to include a fronted adverbial clause: 'Despite these concerns, the UK has expressed its support for Bolivia\u2019s request, asserting that maintaining membership in the convention is crucial.'"}, {"id": 3, "type": "discourse", "target_metrics": ["LC", "CoH"], "location": "paragraph 4, sentences 1-2", "instruction": "Introduce a transitional phrase to link ideas: 'On the other hand, Nancie Prud\u2019homme of the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy argues that opposition to Bolivia\u2019s request is unjustified from a legal standpoint, given the evolving global trends supporting cultural and indigenous rights.'"}, {"id": 4, "type": "length", "target_metrics": ["MDD", "CS"], "location": "paragraph 5, sentences 3-4", "instruction": "Expand on the historical context by adding more details: 'The decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report that some critics argue lacked scientific validation and moral imperatives; however, this decision has been legally upheld despite ongoing debates.'"}]}}

However, the institute cautioned against direct comparisons between the 2012 and 2013 samples \u2013 which both polled around 40,000 managers \u2013 as they are not identical.\nA sub-set of 17,000 individual managers, whose salaries and bonuses have been tracked over a number of years, showed that male managers\u2019 earnings are rising faster than women\u2019s for the first time in five years, with men enjoying total increases of 3.2% compared with 2.8% for women, when salaries and bonuses are combined.\nAt the most senior level, male directors\u2019 earnings rose by 5.3% over the past 12 months, compared with just 1.1% for female directors.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "In a comprehensive analysis of remuneration disparities within the managerial echelons of British enterprises, it has been revealed that male executives are awarded bonuses approximately twice as substantial as those received by their female counterparts occupying equivalent positions. Over an extended career trajectory, this translates to a differential in bonus earnings amounting to \u00a3141,500 more for men than women.\n\nAccording to data released by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), male executives garnered average bonuses of \u00a36,442 in 2012, while their female colleagues received only \u00a33,029. Female directors experienced a similar disparity, with bonuses totalling \u00a336,270 over the past year compared to the \u00a363,700 awarded to male executives.\n\nThese findings underscore the persistent inequities in pay within British business environments. Advocates for workplace equality argue that measures must be implemented to address these imbalances. According to Ann Francke, chief executive of the CMI, fostering a more flexible and less traditionally masculine corporate culture could mitigate such disparities; as she stated, \"fostering a more flexible and less traditionally masculine corporate culture could help reduce these disparities.\" Furthermore, transparency regarding performance evaluations and bonus distributions is essential for addressing these disparities.\n\nWhile some argue that these discrepancies might be influenced by women's participation in roles with less frequent bonus opportunities, the magnitude of the bonuses awarded to male executives exacerbates Britain\u2019s existing pay gap. The government acknowledges this disparity but maintains that full-time male employees continue to earn 10% more than their female counterparts, despite performing equivalent tasks and contributing equally to company success.\n\nMaria Miller, the Minister for Women and Equalities, highlighted that CMI's findings are indicative of broader trends in the workplace where women still receive lower compensation despite performing equivalent tasks. She noted that while progress is being made, significant strides remain to achieve full equality.\n\nTo address these issues, the government has initiated programs such as the Think, Act, Report scheme, which encourages companies to improve their practices in recruiting, promoting, and compensating women. This initiative has garnered support from 120 organizations, including large corporations such as Tesco, BT, Unilever, and Eversheds, which have committed to improving their practices in recruiting, promoting, and compensating women.\n\nHowever, despite these efforts, the CMI's data also indicated a narrowing of the pay gap between male executives and female executives since 2012.", "rewritten_text_profile": [117.305, 0.61, 1.0, 3.264, 4.0, 1.571, 0.886]}, "critic_output": {"status": "revision required", "action_plan": [{"id": 1, "type": "lexical", "target_metrics": ["MTLD", "LD"], "location": "paragraph 2, sentences 3-4", "instruction": "Replace the repeated phrase 'male executives' with more varied expressions such as 'executive men', 'top male managers', and 'high-ranking male executives'."}, {"id": 2, "type": "syntactic", "target_metrics": ["MDD", "CS"], "location": "paragraph 3, sentences 1-2", "instruction": "Rearrange the sentence structure to include a fronted adverbial clause: 'According to data released by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), in 2012 male executives garnered average bonuses of \u00a36,442 while their female colleagues received only \u00a33,029.'"}, {"id": 3, "type": "discourse", "target_metrics": ["LC", "CoH"], "location": "paragraph 5, sentences 1-2", "instruction": "Introduce a transition phrase to link the ideas: 'Furthermore, transparency regarding performance evaluations and bonus distributions is essential for addressing these disparities, as highlighted by Ann Francke.'"}, {"id": 4, "type": "length", "target_metrics": ["CS"], "location": "paragraph 6, sentences 3-5", "instruction": "Expand the sentence to include more clauses: 'The government acknowledges this disparity but maintains that full-time male employees continue to earn 10% more than their female counterparts, despite performing equivalent tasks and contributing equally to company success.'"}]}}

That rise would ruin crops and make life in many cities too hot.\nAs temperatures rise and oceans become warmer, there will be big changes in annual rainfall in tropical and subtropical regions, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in Stockholm and published online in September 2013.\nEast Africa can expect more short rainfalls and west Africa should expect heavier monsoons. Burma, Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones; elsewhere in southern Asia, there will probably be heavier summer rainfalls.

They said the number of people at risk of hunger might increase by 10% to 20% by 2050.\n\u201cThe changing climate is already hurting the \ufb01ght against hunger, and it looks like it will get worse,\u201d said Oxfam. \u201cA hot world is a hungry world\u201d.", "human_reference": "\ufeffLow-income countries will remain on the front line of human-induced climate change over the next century, experiencing gradual sea-level rises, stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rainfall, and larger and longer heatwaves, according to the most thorough assessment of the issue yet.\nThe last major United Nations (UN) assessment, in 2007, predicted runaway temperature rises of 6\u00b0C or more by the end of the century. That is now thought unlikely by scientists, but average land and sea temperatures are expected to continue rising throughout this century, possibly reaching 4\u00b0C above present levels \u2013 enough to devastate crops and make life in many cities unbearably hot.\nAs temperatures climb and oceans warm, tropical and subtropical regions will face sharp changes in annual rainfall, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in Stockholm and published online in September.\nEast Africa can expect to experience increased short rains, while west Africa should expect heavier monsoons. Burma, Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones; elsewhere in southern Asia, heavier summer rains are anticipated. Indonesia may receive less rainfall between July and October, but the coastal regions around the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand can expect increased rainfall extremes when cyclones hit land.\n\u201cIt is virtually certain that, in the long term, global precipitation will change. High latitude countries, such as in Europe or North America, are expected to receive more rainfall, but many subtropical arid and semi-arid regions will likely experience less precipitation. Over wet tropical regions, extreme precipitation events will very likely be more intense and more frequent in a warmer world,\u201d said the report\u2019s authors.\nThey added: \u201cMonsoon onset dates are likely to become earlier or not to change much while monsoon withdrawal rates are very likely to delay, resulting in a lengthening of the season.\u201d\nScientists in developing countries and commentators have welcomed the report, which they said backed their own observations.\n\u201cThe IPCC makes the case that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before.

Although the global frequency of tropical cyclones is expected to decrease or remain essentially unchanged, they may become more intense, with stronger winds and heavier rainfall.\nLife in many developing-country cities could become practically unbearable, given that urban temperatures are already well above those in surrounding countryside. Much higher temperatures could reduce the length of the growing period in some parts of Africa by up to 20%, the report said.\nDr Camilla Toulmin, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, says: \u201cClimate models are not yet robust enough to predict impacts at local and regional scales, but it is clear that everybody is vulnerable in some way.\u201d\nThe charity Oxfam predicted that world hunger would worsen as climate changes inevitably hurt crop production and disrupt incomes. They suggested the number of people at risk of hunger might climb by 10% to 20% by 2050, with daily per-capita calorie availability falling across the world.\n\u201cThe changing climate is already jeopardizing gains in the \ufb01ght against hunger, and it looks set to worsen,\u201d said Oxfam. \u201cA hot world is a hungry world.

Additionally, more frequent and severe cyclones, coupled with prolonged heatwaves and altered precipitation patterns, will reshape weather conditions globally. The IPCC's latest report, published in September 2013, underscores that the global average temperature is likely to increase by approximately 4\u00b0C during this century, surpassing previous estimates of a 6\u00b0C rise by the end of the century.\n\nThese climatic shifts are anticipated to disrupt agricultural productivity and urban infrastructure. For instance, East Africa may experience more sporadic rainfall events, while West Africa could witness intensified monsoon seasons. Coastal regions in Southeast Asia, particularly those bordering the South China Sea and Gulf of Thailand, will face increased cyclone activity and heavier downpours.\n\nThe report further highlights that rising temperatures and warmer oceans will precipitate substantial changes in annual precipitation patterns across tropical and subtropical zones. Northern countries like Europe or North America might receive more rainfall, whereas many dry regions could experience reduced moisture levels. Furthermore, the monsoon season is expected to commence earlier and extend longer than previously observed.\n\nScientists from developing nations are cautiously optimistic about these findings, acknowledging that climate change has already manifested in their regions. Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, asserts, \"The IPCC confirms that climate change is real and more pronounced now than ever before. We have witnessed its effects in Bangladesh and across South Asia.\"\n\nSea-level rise predictions have been revised downward; an average increase of 40 to 62 centimeters by 2100 is anticipated. However, millions of inhabitants in major developing world cities such as Lagos and Calcutta remain at risk due to rising sea levels.\n\nThe report also predicts that weather-related disasters will become more frequent in a warmer climate. Although the number of tropical cyclones may not change significantly, their intensity could increase, leading to stronger winds and heavier rainfall events.

This might be a disaster for the climate.\nOne of the biggest reasons behind the rise in coal use is the big increase in the use of shale gas in the US.\nNew research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that all over the world people are using more coal, except in the US, where shale gas is now more popular than coal. Because the US is using less coal, coal prices across the world have reduced. This has made coal more attractive, even in Europe.\nMaria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said that the amount of coal we use \u201ccontinues to grow each year and, if no changes are made, coal will catch oil within ten years.\u201d\nCoal is available in large amounts and it can be found in most regions of the world, unlike oil and gas, and it is cheap to extract. The IEA says that China and India will drive world coal use in the next five years, and India will probably overtake the US as the world\u2019s second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia is the biggest coal exporter.\nAccording to the IEA\u2019s Medium-Term Coal Market Report, the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today.\nWith the highest carbon emissions, coal makes climate change a lot worse, especially when it is burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. Coal can also produce sulphur emissions \u2013 these lead to acid rain \u2013 and mercury and soot-particle pollution.\nVan der Hoeven says that we should make coal more expensive so that people prefer to use cleaner technologies such as renewable power. Providing cheaper gas is the only way to reduce demand for coal. This has happened in the US because of the big increase in the production of shale gas there in the past five years.\nShe said: \u201cThe US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note.\u201d\nIf something isn\u2019t done soon there will be more climate change.", "human_reference": "\ufeffCoal is likely to rival oil as the world\u2019s biggest source of energy in the next five years, with potentially disastrous consequences for the climate, according to the world\u2019s leading authority on energy economics.\nOne of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the US.\nNew research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world \u2013 even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets \u2013 except in the US, where shale gas has displaced coal. The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally. This has made it more attractive, even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme.\nMaria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said: \u201cCoal\u2019s share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade.\u201d\nCoal is abundant and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. As a result, coal was used to meet nearly half of the rise in demand for energy globally in the past decade. According to the IEA, demand from China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with India likely to overtake the US as the world\u2019s second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter, having temporarily overtaken Australia.\nAccording to the IEA\u2019s Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today \u2013 the equivalent of the current coal consumption of Russia and the US combined. Global coal consumption is forecast to reach 4.3bn tonnes of oil equivalent by 2017, while oil consumption is forecast to reach 4.4bn tonnes by the same date.\nWith the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. When these are not equipped with special \u201cscrubbing\u201d equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions \u2013 the leading cause of acid rain \u2013 and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles.\nVan der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power generation, only competition from lower-priced gas could realistically cut demand for coal. This has happened in the US, owing to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years.\nShe said: \u201cThe US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market, marked by flexible pricing and fuelled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably, can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers\u2019 electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note.\u201d\nThat would mean producing much more shale gas, as conventional gas resources are running down in their easily accessible locations.\nIn Europe, the Emissions Trading Scheme was supposed to discourage high-carbon power generation by imposing a price on carbon dioxide emissions. This was done through issuing generators and energy-intensive companies with a set quota of emissions permits, requiring them to buy extra permits if they needed to emit more than their allowance.

This might be a disaster for the climate.\nOne of the biggest reasons behind the rise in coal use is the big increase in the use of shale gas in the US.\nNew research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that all over the world people are using more coal, except in the US, where shale gas is now more popular than coal. Because the US is using less coal, coal prices across the world have reduced. This has made coal more attractive, even in Europe.\nMaria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said that the amount of coal we use \u201ccontinues to grow each year and, if no changes are made, coal will catch oil within ten years.\u201d\nCoal is available in large amounts and it can be found in most regions of the world, unlike oil and gas, and it is cheap to extract. The IEA says that China and India will drive world coal use in the next five years, and India will probably overtake the US as the world\u2019s second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia is the biggest coal exporter.\nAccording to the IEA\u2019s Medium-Term Coal Market Report, the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today.\nWith the highest carbon emissions, coal makes climate change a lot worse, especially when it is burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. Coal can also produce sulphur emissions \u2013 these lead to acid rain \u2013 and mercury and soot-particle pollution.\nVan der Hoeven says that we should make coal more expensive so that people prefer to use cleaner technologies such as renewable power. Providing cheaper gas is the only way to reduce demand for coal. This has happened in the US because of the big increase in the production of shale gas there in the past five years.\nShe said: \u201cThe US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note.\u201d\nIf something isn\u2019t done soon there will be more climate change.", "human_reference": "\ufeffCoal is likely to rival oil as the world\u2019s biggest source of energy in the next five years, with potentially disastrous consequences for the climate, according to the world\u2019s leading authority on energy economics.\nOne of the biggest factors behind the rise in coal use has been the massive increase in the use of shale gas in the US.\nNew research from the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that coal consumption is increasing all over the world \u2013 even in countries and regions with carbon-cutting targets \u2013 except in the US, where shale gas has displaced coal. The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally. This has made it more attractive, even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme.\nMaria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said: \u201cCoal\u2019s share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade.\u201d\nCoal is abundant and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. As a result, coal was used to meet nearly half of the rise in demand for energy globally in the past decade. According to the IEA, demand from China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with India likely to overtake the US as the world\u2019s second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter, having temporarily overtaken Australia.\nAccording to the IEA\u2019s Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today \u2013 the equivalent of the current coal consumption of Russia and the US combined. Global coal consumption is forecast to reach 4.3bn tonnes of oil equivalent by 2017, while oil consumption is forecast to reach 4.4bn tonnes by the same date.\nWith the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. When these are not equipped with special \u201cscrubbing\u201d equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions \u2013 the leading cause of acid rain \u2013 and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles.\nVan der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power generation, only competition from lower-priced gas could realistically cut demand for coal. This has happened in the US, owing to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years.\nShe said: \u201cThe US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market, marked by flexible pricing and fuelled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably, can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers\u2019 electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note.\u201d\nThat would mean producing much more shale gas, as conventional gas resources are running down in their easily accessible locations.\nIn Europe, the Emissions Trading Scheme was supposed to discourage high-carbon power generation by imposing a price on carbon dioxide emissions. This was done through issuing generators and energy-intensive companies with a set quota of emissions permits, requiring them to buy extra permits if they needed to emit more than their allowance. But an over-allocation, coupled with the effects of the financial crisis and recession, has led to a large surplus of permits on the market, which has in turn led to a plunge in permit prices. At current levels \u2013 a few euros per tonne of carbon \u2013 there is little incentive to seek out lower carbon fuels, and coal is enjoying a renaissance in Europe.\nThat means one of the world\u2019s only regulatory market mechanisms aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions is failing in its key goals. The world faces the likelihood of an increased risk of climate change as a result of this runaway consumption of the highest carbon fossil fuel.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The impending dominance of coal as a primary energy source within the next five years is likely to overshadow oil's current supremacy, potentially precipitating a catastrophic impact on global climate conditions.\n\nA significant factor driving this shift is the marked rise in shale gas utilization observed predominantly in the United States. Without intervention, it is expected that coal production will surpass oil within a decade, as the widespread availability and affordability of coal make it increasingly cost-effective and economically advantageous.\n\nFurthermore, according to recent analyses by the International Energy Agency (IEA), worldwide coal consumption has escalated across various regions, particularly in China and India, with notable exceptions such as the United States, where shale gas has supplanted coal as the preferred energy source. This transition has led to a decline in domestic coal prices due to increased shale gas utilization, making it economically advantageous for other nations, including Europe.\n\nThe IEA\u2019s Medium-Term Coal Market Report forecasts an increase of 1.2 billion additional tonnes of coal burned annually by 2017. Global coal consumption is expected to rise significantly, with China and India leading this trend. Specifically, while economic factors drive the rise in coal production, geopolitical concerns such as energy security play a significant role.\n\nMoreover, according to recent analyses by the International Energy Agency (IEA), worldwide coal consumption has escalated across various regions, particularly in China and India, where domestic coal prices have declined due to increased shale gas utilization. This trend is expected to continue, making coal increasingly cost-effective and economically advantageous for other nations, including Europe.\n\nGiven these concerns, Maria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, advocates for policies that increase the cost of coal, thereby encouraging a shift towards cleaner alternatives like renewable energy sources.
