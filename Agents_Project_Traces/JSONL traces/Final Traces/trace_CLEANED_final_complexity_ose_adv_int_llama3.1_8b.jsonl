The company has applied to register its brand as a top-level domain name (currently .com), but the South American governments argue that this would preclude the use of this internet address for environmental conservation, indigenous rights promotion, and other public interest purposes.\n\nThis contentious issue is intricately linked to broader debates regarding the purpose and governance of the internet. The proposed expansion of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a US-based non-profit organization, has sparked intense discussion. ICANN has received bids worth almost $200,000 each for hundreds of new gTLDs to be added to the existing 22.\n\nAmazon has submitted applications for numerous new domains, including .shop, .song, .book, and .kindle. However, its application for its own brand has generated the most controversy.

Brazil and Peru have lodged objections against a bid submitted by Amazon, the US-based e-commerce giant, for a prime piece of cyberspace: .amazon. The company has applied to register its brand as a top-level domain name (currently .com), but the South American governments argue that this would preclude the use of this internet address for environmental conservation, indigenous rights promotion, and other public interest purposes.\n\nThis contentious issue is intricately linked to broader debates regarding the purpose and governance of the internet. The proposed expansion of generic top-level domains (gTLDs) by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a US-based non-profit organization, has sparked intense discussion. ICANN has received bids worth almost $200,000 each for hundreds of new gTLDs to be added to the existing 22.\n\nAmazon has submitted applications for numerous new domains, including .shop, .song, .book, and .kindle. However, its application for its own brand has generated the most controversy.

It may also speed up planning decisions in Iqaluit.\nThe project leader for Google said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns. However, the high costs of moving people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory means they might have to use cheaper methods in the future, for example, sending equipment to the area and asking volunteers to complete the map.", "human_reference": "\ufeffIt has charted the world\u2019s highest peaks, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest and even provided a glimpse into North Korea. But Google\u2019s mission to map the world has largely steered clear of the inhospitable Arctic.\nNow, however, the search-engine firm is embarking on what might be the most significant update to centuries of polar cartography \u2013 and one it hopes will help provide a better understanding of life on the permafrost for millions of web users. Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpack- mounted telescopic camera.\nHelped by an Inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of Baffin Island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.\nThe town of 7,000 people will go on display via Google\u2019s popular Street View application in July 2013.\nAaron Brindle, project leader, said: \u201cI live in Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn\u2019t been the case in the north.\u201d\nUnlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town\u2019s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.\nThe team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.\nMayor John Graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers.\nGraham understands the enthusiasm. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.\nAnother difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit\u2019s growth.\nThe test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.\nThe gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why Google selected the less- hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.\nBrindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Google\u2019s ambitions.\nThe next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that three, four, five years from now we\u2019ll look back and see a very different map of Canada\u2019s north,\u201d Brindle added.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The permafrost region, encompassing the Arctic tundra and ice caps, has been a challenging terrain for cartographers due to its inhospitable climate and remote location. However, Google's mission to map the world has now expanded to this previously uncharted territory, with the aim of providing a more comprehensive understanding of life in these extreme environments. A team of experts from Google has been dispatched to Iqaluit, the largest town in Nunavut, Canadian territory, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and winter gear.\n\nThe team, accompanied by an Inuit mapping expert and followed by curious locals, spent four days collecting data and images that will enable the isolated community on Baffin Island to access essential services and amenities previously unavailable to them. The town's 7,000 residents will soon be able to explore their surroundings through Google's popular Street View application, which will go live in July 2013.\n\nIn contrast to more accessible regions, where mapping has been facilitated by vehicles equipped with specialized cameras, the Iqaluit project required mappers to traverse snow-covered roads and uncharted trails, some of which are ephemeral due to the short summer months. The team even ventured onto a 15km dead-end road known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about polar bear encounters.\n\nJohn Graham, mayor of Iqaluit, acknowledged the enthusiasm of the locals who followed Google's digital map makers during their work. He noted that the Street View project builds upon the legacy of English explorer Martin Frobisher and Captain Elliott Roosevelt's 1941 flight, which led to the establishment of a military airbase in the area.\n\nWhile Google's existing maps were largely accurate, they lacked crucial information about recent developments in Iqaluit. The team worked closely with local residents to correct errors and ensure that businesses and homeowners were accurately represented on the map. Approximately 30 Inuit elders, businesspeople, and high-school pupils participated in this effort, using laptop computers to verify their addresses.\n\nFurthermore, the project's significance extends beyond its novelty value, as it will enable Iqaluit to leverage its maps as a promotional tool for potential visitors and residents. Moreover, the maps may facilitate faster decision-making in urban planning and development by providing a more detailed and accurate representation of the town's infrastructure and geography. The project leader expressed hope that similar initiatives would be undertaken in other northern towns, although the high costs of logistics in this vast territory might necessitate alternative approaches, such as deploying equipment and relying on local volunteers to complete the mapping process.\n\nIn addition, the team's efforts have also highlighted the importance of community engagement and participation in the mapping process. By involving local residents in the verification process, Google has not only ensured the accuracy of their maps but also fostered a sense of ownership and responsibility among the community members. This collaborative approach has the potential to be replicated in other regions, promoting a more inclusive and participatory approach to urban planning and development.\n\nThe project's long-term implications are multifaceted, with potential benefits extending beyond the realm of mapping and navigation. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of life in these extreme environments, Google's Street View project has the potential to contribute to scientific research, environmental monitoring, and emergency response efforts. Furthermore, the project's emphasis on community engagement and participation may serve as a model for other initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable development and community empowerment in remote and underserved regions.\n\nIn order to facilitate more efficient navigation through the town's infrastructure, the team has also developed a series of detailed maps highlighting key amenities such as healthcare facilities, schools, and community centers. These maps will be made available to residents and visitors alike, providing them with essential information about the location of these services. By doing so, Google aims to promote a greater sense of community and social cohesion among the town's residents.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iqaluit mapping project represents a significant milestone in Google's mission to map the world. By expanding their reach into previously uncharted territories, Google has not only demonstrated its commitment to providing accurate and comprehensive maps but also highlighted the importance of community engagement and participation in the mapping process.

His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.\nAnother difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address.

However, Google's mission to map the world has now expanded to this previously uncharted territory, with the aim of providing a more comprehensive understanding of life in these extreme environments. A team of experts from Google has been dispatched to Iqaluit, the largest town in Nunavut, Canadian territory, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and winter gear.\n\nThe team, accompanied by an Inuit mapping expert and followed by curious locals, spent four days collecting data and images that will enable the isolated community on Baffin Island to access essential services and amenities previously unavailable to them. The town's 7,000 residents will soon be able to explore their surroundings through Google's popular Street View application, which will go live in July 2013.\n\nIn contrast to more accessible regions, where mapping has been facilitated by vehicles equipped with specialized cameras, the Iqaluit project required mappers to traverse snow-covered roads and uncharted trails, some of which are ephemeral due to the short summer months. The team even ventured onto a 15km dead-end road known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about polar bear encounters.\n\nJohn Graham, mayor of Iqaluit, acknowledged the enthusiasm of the locals who followed Google's digital map makers during their work. He noted that the Street View project builds upon the legacy of English explorer Martin Frobisher and Captain Elliott Roosevelt's 1941 flight, which led to the establishment of a military airbase in the area.\n\nWhile Google's existing maps were largely accurate, they lacked crucial information about recent developments in Iqaluit. The team worked closely with local residents to correct errors and ensure that businesses and homeowners were accurately represented on the map. Approximately 30 Inuit elders, businesspeople, and high-school pupils participated in this effort, using laptop computers to verify their addresses.\n\nFurthermore, the project's significance extends beyond its novelty value, as it will enable Iqaluit to leverage its maps as a promotional tool for potential visitors and residents. Moreover, the maps may facilitate faster decision-making in urban planning and development by providing a more detailed and accurate representation of the town's infrastructure and geography. The project leader expressed hope that similar initiatives would be undertaken in other northern towns, although the high costs of logistics in this vast territory might necessitate alternative approaches, such as deploying equipment and relying on local volunteers to complete the mapping process.\n\nIn addition, the team's efforts have also highlighted the importance of community engagement and participation in the mapping process. By involving local residents in the verification process, Google has not only ensured the accuracy of their maps but also fostered a sense of ownership and responsibility among the community members. This collaborative approach has the potential to be replicated in other regions, promoting a more inclusive and participatory approach to urban planning and development.\n\nThe project's long-term implications are multifaceted, with potential benefits extending beyond the realm of mapping and navigation. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of life in these extreme environments, Google's Street View project has the potential to contribute to scientific research, environmental monitoring, and emergency response efforts. Furthermore, the project's emphasis on community engagement and participation may serve as a model for other initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable development and community empowerment in remote and underserved regions.\n\nIn order to facilitate more efficient navigation through the town's infrastructure, the team has also developed a series of detailed maps highlighting key amenities such as healthcare facilities, schools, and community centers. These maps will be made available to residents and visitors alike, providing them with essential information about the location of these services. By doing so, Google aims to promote a greater sense of community and social cohesion among the town's residents.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iqaluit mapping project represents a significant milestone in Google's mission to map the world. By expanding their reach into previously uncharted territories, Google has not only demonstrated its commitment to providing accurate and comprehensive maps but also highlighted the importance of community engagement and participation in the mapping process.

The team even ventured onto a 15km dead-end road known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about polar bear encounters.\n\nJohn Graham, mayor of Iqaluit, acknowledged the enthusiasm of the locals who followed Google's digital map makers during their work. He noted that the Street View project builds upon the legacy of English explorer Martin Frobisher and Captain Elliott Roosevelt's 1941 flight, which led to the establishment of a military airbase in the area.\n\nWhile Google's existing maps were largely accurate, they lacked crucial information about recent developments in Iqaluit. The team worked closely with local residents to correct errors and ensure that businesses and homeowners were accurately represented on the map. Approximately 30 Inuit elders, businesspeople, and high-school pupils participated in this effort, using laptop computers to verify their addresses.\n\nFurthermore, the project's significance extends beyond its novelty value, as it will enable Iqaluit to leverage its maps as a promotional tool for potential visitors and residents. Moreover, the maps may facilitate faster decision-making in urban planning and development by providing a more detailed and accurate representation of the town's infrastructure and geography. The project leader expressed hope that similar initiatives would be undertaken in other northern towns, although the high costs of logistics in this vast territory might necessitate alternative approaches, such as deploying equipment and relying on local volunteers to complete the mapping process.\n\nIn addition, the team's efforts have also highlighted the importance of community engagement and participation in the mapping process. By involving local residents in the verification process, Google has not only ensured the accuracy of their maps but also fostered a sense of ownership and responsibility among the community members. This collaborative approach has the potential to be replicated in other regions, promoting a more inclusive and participatory approach to urban planning and development.\n\nThe project's long-term implications are multifaceted, with potential benefits extending beyond the realm of mapping and navigation. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of life in these extreme environments, Google's Street View project has the potential to contribute to scientific research, environmental monitoring, and emergency response efforts. Furthermore, the project's emphasis on community engagement and participation may serve as a model for other initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable development and community empowerment in remote and underserved regions.\n\nIn order to facilitate more efficient navigation through the town's infrastructure, the team has also developed a series of detailed maps highlighting key amenities such as healthcare facilities, schools, and community centers. These maps will be made available to residents and visitors alike, providing them with essential information about the location of these services. By doing so, Google aims to promote a greater sense of community and social cohesion among the town's residents.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iqaluit mapping project represents a significant milestone in Google's mission to map the world. By expanding their reach into previously uncharted territories, Google has not only demonstrated its commitment to providing accurate and comprehensive maps but also highlighted the importance of community engagement and participation in the mapping process. As the project continues to unfold, it is likely to have far-reaching implications for urban planning, development, and community empowerment in remote and underserved regions.\n\nThe team's efforts have also underscored the significance of cultural sensitivity and awareness in the mapping process. By working closely with local residents and incorporating their knowledge and expertise into the mapping effort, Google has been able to create a more nuanced and accurate representation of the town's geography and infrastructure. This approach has not only ensured the accuracy of the maps but also promoted a greater understanding and appreciation of the cultural heritage of the region.\n\nIn recognition of the project's significance, Google has announced plans to establish a permanent mapping office in Iqaluit, staffed by local residents who will be responsible for maintaining and updating the town's maps. This initiative is seen as a major step forward in promoting community engagement and participation in the mapping process, and it is likely to have a lasting impact on the town's development and growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iqaluit mapping project represents a significant milestone in Google's mission to map the world.

They have with them their warmest winter clothes, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg telescopic camera that they can fix to their backpacks.\nHelped by an Inuit mapping expert, and followed around by curious locals, the team spent four days collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on Baffin Island what people across the globe who live in cities now take for granted.\nThe town of 7,000 people will go on display via Googles popular Street View application in July 2013.\nUnlike more accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera on a car roof, for Googles Iqaluit project mappers walked the towns snowpacked roads and crossed little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the short summer months.\nThe team also walked along part of a 15km dead-end road known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.\nJohn Graham, mayor of Iqaluit, understands the enthusiasm of the locals who followed Googles digital map makers while they worked. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now is while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, an officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase.

His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.\nAnother difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit\u2019s growth.\nThe test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.\nThe gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why Google selected the less- hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.\nBrindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Google\u2019s ambitions.\nThe next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that three, four, five years from now we\u2019ll look back and see a very different map of Canada\u2019s north,\u201d Brindle added.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The permafrost region, encompassing the Arctic tundra and ice caps, has been a challenging terrain for cartographers due to its inhospitable climate and remote location. However, Google's mission to map the world has now expanded to this previously uncharted territory, with the aim of providing a more comprehensive understanding of life in these extreme environments. A team of experts from Google has been dispatched to Iqaluit, the largest town in Nunavut, Canadian territory, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and winter gear.\n\nThe team, accompanied by an Inuit mapping expert and followed by curious locals, spent four days collecting data and images that will enable the isolated community on Baffin Island to access essential services and amenities previously unavailable to them. The town's 7,000 residents will soon be able to explore their surroundings through Google's popular Street View application, which will go live in July 2013.\n\nIn contrast to more accessible regions, where mapping has been facilitated by vehicles equipped with specialized cameras, the Iqaluit project required mappers to traverse snow-covered roads and uncharted trails, some of which are ephemeral due to the short summer months. The team even ventured onto a 15km dead-end road known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about polar bear encounters.\n\nJohn Graham, mayor of Iqaluit, acknowledged the enthusiasm of the locals who followed Google's digital map makers during their work. He noted that the Street View project builds upon the legacy of English explorer Martin Frobisher and Captain Elliott Roosevelt's 1941 flight, which led to the establishment of a military airbase in the area.\n\nWhile Google's existing maps were largely accurate, they lacked crucial information about recent developments in Iqaluit. The team worked closely with local residents to correct errors and ensure that businesses and homeowners were accurately represented on the map. Approximately 30 Inuit elders, businesspeople, and high-school pupils participated in this effort, using laptop computers to verify their addresses.\n\nFurthermore, the project's significance extends beyond its novelty value, as it will enable Iqaluit to leverage its maps as a promotional tool for potential visitors and residents. Moreover, the maps may facilitate faster decision-making in urban planning and development by providing a more detailed and accurate representation of the town's infrastructure and geography. The project leader expressed hope that similar initiatives would be undertaken in other northern towns, although the high costs of logistics in this vast territory might necessitate alternative approaches, such as deploying equipment and relying on local volunteers to complete the mapping process.\n\nIn addition, the team's efforts have also highlighted the importance of community engagement and participation in the mapping process. By involving local residents in the verification process, Google has not only ensured the accuracy of their maps but also fostered a sense of ownership and responsibility among the community members. This collaborative approach has the potential to be replicated in other regions, promoting a more inclusive and participatory approach to urban planning and development.\n\nThe project's long-term implications are multifaceted, with potential benefits extending beyond the realm of mapping and navigation. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of life in these extreme environments, Google's Street View project has the potential to contribute to scientific research, environmental monitoring, and emergency response efforts. Furthermore, the project's emphasis on community engagement and participation may serve as a model for other initiatives aimed at promoting sustainable development and community empowerment in remote and underserved regions.\n\nIn order to facilitate more efficient navigation through the town's infrastructure, the team has also developed a series of detailed maps highlighting key amenities such as healthcare facilities, schools, and community centers. These maps will be made available to residents and visitors alike, providing them with essential information about the location of these services. By doing so, Google aims to promote a greater sense of community and social cohesion among the town's residents.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iqaluit mapping project represents a significant milestone in Google's mission to map the world. By expanding their reach into previously uncharted territories, Google has not only demonstrated its commitment to providing accurate and comprehensive maps but also highlighted the importance of community engagement and participation in the mapping process.

Yet as recently as 2011, BBM was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in Egypt; and, at the time of the London riots, it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen.\n\u201cWe could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next; TV news would catch up four hours later,\u201d said Jean- Pierre Moore, 28. He manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain. Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now. He dismisses the notion that the BBM curfew urged by some MPs would have stopped the looting. \u201cThe social networking wasn\u2019t the reason,\u201d he says. \u201cI know a lot of people who were out rioting. People had been angry for a long time. Mention the words 'stop and search' around here and you immediately have a room full of angry young men.\u201d\nNearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application, says the research firm Enders Analysis, but two-thirds use more than one. Among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use Facebook every day but 46% use alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,\u201d says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist at Enders. \u201cThe smartphone itself has become the platform. All of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others disappear into thin air.\u201d\nThirteen-year-old Bennett has three devices, all hand-me-downs from family members. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone over wi-fi to play games and makes phone calls on an HTC-branded Android phone. His friends are still on BBM \u2013 the four phone thefts at his school so far this term were all BlackBerrys. At the touch of a few buttons, a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owner\u2019s entire contacts book \u2013 several hundred people in some cases; on WhatsApp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. \u201cInstagram is Facebook without parents,\u201d he says. \u201cFacebook has been taken over by the older generation. Once I saw my mum on Facebook, I deleted my account.\u201d\nFor families that may struggle to pay their heating bills this winter, the low price tag attached to buying and communicating on a BlackBerry retains its appeal. Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a second-hand device and a \u00a37-a-month deal from T-Mobile. But trust in the privacy of BBM\u2019s system has been eroded. Part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company\u2019s secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. Prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief.\nAcross town from Stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in well-heeled South Kensington, the older pupils all have Apple logos on their handsets. They all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. \u201cI still have a Blackberry, but I\u2019m the only one,\u201d says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. And how does that make him feel? \u201cIsolated,\u201d he replies.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The proliferation of mobile messaging platforms has led to a paradigmatic shift in the way individuals communicate on their mobile devices. In 2005, BlackBerry's innovative approach to mobile messaging catapulted its smartphone to become one of Canada's most significant exports. However, six years later, during the London riots, BBM's efficacy in mobilizing rioters prompted politicians to consider temporarily shutting down the service. Conversely, two years after that, it was the users themselves who opted to discontinue their usage.\n\nThe decline in demand for BlackBerry phones can be attributed to the emergence of alternative mobile messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger and Apple's iMessage, which offer a plethora of features including video and voice calls, location sharing, and video sharing. WhatsApp, with its 300 million monthly users, has become an indispensable tool for young people, rendering BBM obsolete in their eyes.\n\nThe notion that BBM's wider release would salvage the service is a notion that many people, including James Gooderson, an 18-year-old technology blogger, dispute. According to him, WhatsApp has made BlackBerrys unnecessary for young individuals. Furthermore, BBM's limitations are starkly evident when compared to other services such as Skype and Viber, which offer video and voice calls, and Path, which enables location sharing.\n\nThe shift towards visual communication is a trend that is gaining momentum, with Instagram and Snapchat leading the charge. These platforms have opened up new avenues for mobile messaging, allowing users to share photos, videos, and even stickers. The fact that these services are free and accessible on any phone with an internet connection has further contributed to their popularity.\n\nThe significance of BBM in facilitating communication during times of crisis is a testament to its efficacy. During the London riots, it was used as a means of disseminating information, allowing users to stay informed about the whereabouts of rioters. However, this aspect of BBM's functionality has been largely superseded by other services.\n\nThe notion that a shutdown of BBM would have halted the looting is a notion that Jean-Pierre Moore, 28, disputes. As someone who manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, he believes that social networking was not the primary reason for the riots. Instead, it was a complex interplay of factors that contributed to the unrest.\n\nThe proliferation of social networking applications has created a multifaceted environment where individuals can communicate with ease. According to Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist, this environment is characterized by the use of multiple apps, each with its own unique features and functionalities. Apps rise and fall like fireworks, some lasting while others disappear.\n\nThirteen-year-old Bennett's experience with BBM is a telling example of how individuals are adapting to this new landscape. He uses his BlackBerry for messaging, an iPhone for gaming, and an Android phone for making calls. His friends are still on BBM, but he has largely abandoned it in favor of Instagram, which he describes as \"Facebook without parents.\" This sentiment is echoed by many young people who feel that Facebook has been taken over by the older generation.\n\nThe low cost of using a BlackBerry remains an advantage, with unlimited mobile messages available to anyone with a secondhand phone and a 7-a-month deal from a telecoms company. However, this aspect of BBM's functionality is no longer sufficient to keep users loyal. The erosion of trust in BBM's privacy has led many people to abandon the service in favor of more secure alternatives.\n\nAcross town from Stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in South Kensington, the older pupils all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory, and they are no longer isolated by their usage of it. As one teenager standing with a circle of friends remarks, \"I still have a BlackBerry, but I'm the only one.\" His response to this question is telling: \"Isolated.\"", "rewritten_text_profile": [99.011, 0.554, 1.0, 3.039, 3.438, 1.546, 0.877]}, "critic_output": {"status": "revision required", "action_plan": [{"id": 1, "type": "lexical", "target_metrics": ["MTLD", "LS"], "location": "paragraph 2, sentences 3-5", "instruction": "Replace repeated phrases such as 'mobile messaging platforms' with more varied expressions like 'messaging apps', 'social media services', and 'communication tools'."}, {"id": 2, "type": "syntactic", "target_metrics": ["MDD", "CS"], "location": "paragraph 3, sentences 1-3", "instruction": "Introduce more complex sentence structures by using subordinate clauses and relative pronouns to increase the mean dependency distance (MDD) and clausal density (CS)."}, {"id": 3, "type": "discourse", "target_metrics": ["CoH", "LC"], "location": "paragraphs 4-6", "instruction": "Improve coherence by adding transitional phrases and words to connect ideas between sentences, and increase lexical cohesion by repeating key terms and concepts throughout the text."}, {"id": 4, "type": "length", "target_metrics": ["text length"], "location": "entire text", "instruction": "Expand the text to meet the target length requirements by adding more examples, explanations, or supporting evidence to illustrate key points."}]}}

No state has paid any attention to decades of developing international norms on cultural and indigenous rights, which support Bolivia\u2019s efforts.\u201d\nThe decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report produced by the UN Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf, which proponents of drug liberalization say was not based on supporting evidence. In an interview in 1949, the head of the Commission, Howard B Fonda, signalled his opposition to the chewing of coca leaves before his inquiry had begun. Fonda told an interviewer: \u201cWe believe that the daily, inveterate use of coca leaves by chewing \u2026 is not only thoroughly noxious and therefore detrimental, but is also the cause of racial degeneration in many centres of population, and of the decadence that visibly shows in numerous Indians \u2026 Our studies will confirm the certainty of our assertions and we hope we can present a rational plan of action \u2026 to attain the absolute and sure abolition of this pernicious habit.\u201d\nThe growing of coca leaves is legal and licensed in Bolivia. The policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country, leading some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The Bolivian government's assertion that its indigenous people have the right to engage in coca leaf cultivation, a traditional practice integral to their ancestral traditions and native customs, has precipitated intense international debate and could potentially alter global drug policy paradigms.

Research has shown that companies with a smaller gender pay gap tend to outperform those with a larger gap, highlighting the importance of addressing this issue in order to drive business success. Furthermore, the perpetuation of unequal pay practices can also have negative impacts on employee morale and productivity, ultimately affecting an organization's bottom line.\n\nIn light of these findings, it is essential that businesses take proactive steps to address the pay gap and promote greater equality in the workplace. This can be achieved through a range of strategies, including implementing more transparent and flexible compensation structures, providing training and development opportunities for women, and promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels of the organization.\n\nBy taking these steps, organizations can not only help to close the pay gap but also create a more positive and inclusive work environment that benefits both employees and business outcomes. As Ann Francke noted, \"It's time for businesses to take action and address this issue head-on. We need to prioritize outcomes over traditional metrics and promote greater transparency around performance and rewards.\" By working together, we can create a more equal and prosperous future for all.\n\nIn conclusion, the persistence of the pay gap in British business is a pressing concern that requires immediate attention from policymakers, businesses, and individuals alike. By implementing targeted interventions and promoting greater equality in the workplace, we can help to close this gap and drive business success. As Maria Miller noted, \"We have made progress, but there is still much work to be done before true equality can be achieved in the workplace.\" Let us continue to work together towards a more equal future for all.\n\nThe government's initiatives aimed at promoting greater flexibility and transparency in the workplace are a step in the right direction. However, more needs to be done to address the root causes of the pay gap and promote greater equality in the workplace. As experts caution, \"The data may be influenced by factors such as women being more likely to work in industries where bonus payments are less common, which could exacerbate the pay gap.\" Therefore, it is essential that businesses take proactive steps to address this issue and promote greater equality in the workplace.\n\nIn addition to implementing targeted interventions, organizations can also benefit from adopting a more inclusive approach to management. This can be achieved by prioritizing outcomes over traditional metrics such as time spent in the office and promoting greater transparency around performance and rewards. By doing so, businesses can not only improve their overall performance but also enhance the well-being of their employees through the implementation of more effective compensation structures.\n\nFurthermore, organizations can also benefit from providing training and development opportunities for women to help them advance in their careers and close the pay gap. This can be achieved by offering mentorship programs, leadership development courses, and other initiatives that promote career advancement and professional growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the persistence of the pay gap in British business is a pressing concern that requires immediate attention from policymakers, businesses, and individuals alike.

Police inside responded with pepper spray and perhaps more \u2013 the Guardian saw one protester passed out and bleeding heavily from a wound in the upper arm.\nThe causes pursued by the protesters varied widely. \u201cWe are here because we hate the government. They do nothing for us,\u201d said Oscar Jos\u00e9 Santos, a 19 year old who was with a group of hooded youths from the Rocinha favela.\n\u201cI\u2019m an architect but I have been unemployed for six months. There must be something wrong with this country,\u201d said Nadia al Husin, holding up a banner calling on the government to do more for education.\nAt a far smaller rally in Brasilia, demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the high-security area of the national congress. Several climbed onto the roof.\nIn Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti.\nIn Porto Alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters attempted to force their way into the office of the state governor. There were also rallies in Belem, Salvador and elsewhere.\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, which had seen the fiercest clashes the previous week and the main allegations of police violence, large crowds gathered once again but initial reports suggested the marches passed peacefully.\nReflecting the importance of social networks in spreading the message about the protests, some in S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 where numbers were estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000 \u2013 carried banners declaring \u201cWe come from Facebook\u201d.\nMost protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. \u201cMy generation has never experienced this,\u201d said Thiago Firbida, a student. \u201cSince the dictatorship, Brazilians never bothered to take over the streets. They did not believe they had a reason to. But now Brazil is once again in crisis, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.\u201d\nComparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere. Another global link was evident in the handful of demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks, associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests.\nBrazil\u2019s demonstrations are being referred to as the \u201cvinegar revolution\u201d (after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to counter tear gas), as well as the \u201c20-cent revolution\u201d (due to the bus price rise) and the Passe Livre (after the demand for free public transport).\nSome said the protests felt un-Brazilian but liberating. \u201cOur politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. Brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes \u2013 they enjoy partying rather than protesting \u2013 but something is changing,\u201d said Deli Borsari, a 53-year-old yoga instructor.\nFollowing widespread news coverage of the costs of new and refurbished stadiums, the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the focuses of the protests. Before the opening match in Brasilia, crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children, as the sound of shots \u2013 perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas \u2013 was heard.\nAnother protest march, near Rio\u2019s Maracana Stadium, was met with a similarly heavy police response.\nMost of the rallies appeared to start peacefully until they confronted the security forces, who are largely organized at a regional level. President Dilma Rousseff condones the protests, according to her aides. \u201cThe president believes peaceful protests are legitimate and proper for a democracy, and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate,\u201d said Helena Chagas of the president\u2019s office.\nHowever, the president was booed at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup. With the economy in bad shape and social unrest on the rise, she faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The woefully inadequate provision of public services has been a longstanding issue in Brazil, with many citizens expressing frustration at the exorbitant costs associated with the World Cup, which have been exacerbated by the lavish expenditures on international sporting events and the subsequent burden on taxpayers. The protests that unfolded across the country were a manifestation of this discontent, as over 100,000 people converged on the streets to express their grievances regarding policing practices and resource allocation for these high-profile events.\n\nThe demonstrations began peacefully but escalated into clashes with police and arson attacks on vehicles and buses, precipitating a scenario that was both chaotic and calamitous. The timing of the rallies coincided with the commencement of the Confederations Cup, a football tournament that has become a focal point for protesters' grievances regarding the allocation of resources for international sporting events, which have been criticized as being disproportionately high.\n\nThe demonstrations brought together individuals frustrated by burdensome expenditures, subpar public services, and concerns about inequality and corruption, thereby underscoring the need for systemic reforms. While the vast majority of protests remained peaceful, several police officers were injured, at least one vehicle was overturned and set ablaze, and windows were shattered, highlighting the gravity of the situation.\n\nAs night fell, a large crowd set fires outside a government office, vandalized the building's windows, and spray-painted graffiti on the walls, including phrases such as \"Revolution,\" \"Down with Paes,\" and \"Hate police.\" Police responded with pepper spray. The protesters' motivations varied widely, with some expressing frustration at the government's inaction, while others cited personal experiences of unemployment and economic hardship.\n\nIn Brasilia, demonstrators breached police lines to enter the high-security area of the national congress, with several climbing onto the roof. In Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters attempting to access a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti. Similar scenes unfolded in Porto Alegre, where demonstrators set fire to a bus, and in Curitiba, where protesters attempted to force their way into the state governor's office.\n\nRallies also took place in Belem, Salvador, and other locations. In S\u00e3o Paulo, large crowds gathered, but reports indicated that the marches remained peaceful. Many protesters were young, with some experiencing their first major rally. Thiago Firbida, a student, noted, \"My generation has never experienced this. Since the dictatorship, Brazilians have never bothered to demonstrate like this.\"\n\nThe protests drew comparisons with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere, with some demonstrators donning Guy Fawkes masks associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street movements. Brazil's demonstrations have been referred to as the vinegar revolution (due to police arresting individuals carrying vinegar to counteract tear gas) and the 20-cent revolution (in reference to the bus fare hike).\n\nSome protesters described the experience as un-Brazilian but liberating, emphasizing the need for politicians to acknowledge the collective strength of the people. Deli Borsari, a 53-year-old yoga instructor, observed, \"Our politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. Brazilians are too nice sometimes \u2013 they enjoy partying rather than protesting \u2013 but something is changing.\"\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to note that the Confederations Cup has been a focal point for protests, with demonstrators reacting to news of exorbitant costs associated with new and refurbished stadiums, which have been criticized as being excessively high. Before the opening match in Brasilia, riot police dispersed crowds of protesters, while footage showed frightened Japanese supporters fleeing the area with their children as they heard the sound of shots \u2013 possibly rubber bullets or tear gas.\n\nPresident Dilma Rousseff has expressed support for peaceful protests, viewing them as legitimate and essential for a democracy. However, she was booed at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup, facing a significant political challenge both now and in 2014, when Brazil will host the World Cup and hold a presidential election. The widespread discontent among Brazilians has sparked a national debate about the country's priorities, with many calling for systemic reforms to address issues such as inequality, corruption, and inadequate public services.\n\nIn light of these developments, it is crucial that policymakers take into account the collective strength of the people and work towards creating a more equitable society. By doing so, they can help to alleviate the burden on taxpayers and ensure that public resources are allocated in a manner that benefits all citizens, rather than just a select few. The protests have highlighted the need for transparency and accountability in government, and it is essential that these demands are met in order to build trust between citizens and their leaders.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of this crisis will depend on the ability of policymakers to respond effectively to the concerns of the people. By working together and prioritizing the needs of all citizens, they can help to create a more just and equitable society, one that is truly representative of the Brazilian people's aspirations for a better future.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal, it is essential to address the root causes of the protests, including inequality, corruption, and inadequate public services. This can be done by implementing policies that promote social justice, economic equality, and transparency in government. Furthermore, policymakers must work towards creating a more inclusive and participatory democracy, where citizens have a greater say in decision-making processes.\n\nBy taking these steps, Brazil can move towards a brighter future, one that is characterized by greater social cohesion, economic prosperity, and political stability. The protests have provided an opportunity for Brazilians to come together and demand change, and it is now up to policymakers to respond effectively to their concerns and create a more just and equitable society.\n\nIn this regard, the Confederations Cup has become a focal point for protests, with demonstrators reacting to news of exorbitant costs associated with new and refurbished stadiums.

One of the pivotal factors driving the surge in coal consumption has been the unprecedented increase in shale gas utilization in the US. Research conducted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) reveals that coal usage is escalating globally, even in nations and regions with carbon-reduction targets, except for the US, where shale gas has supplanted coal as the preferred energy source.

As the fossil fuel with the highest carbon emissions, coal significantly contributes to climate change, particularly when burned in antiquated, inefficient power plants. When these facilities are not equipped with specialized scrubbing equipment to remove pollutants, coal can also produce sulfur emissions \u2013 the primary cause of acid rain \u2013 and mercury and soot-particle pollution.\n\nVan der Hoeven suggests that without a high carbon price to deter coal consumption and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable energy, only competition from lower-priced gas can reduce demand for coal. This phenomenon has been observed in the US, where the extraordinary increase in shale gas production over the past five years has led to a decline in coal usage. She notes: \"The US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions, and consumers' electricity bills. Europe, China, and other regions should take heed.\" Furthermore, she emphasizes the need for a comprehensive approach to mitigate the impacts of coal consumption on the environment and human societies.\n\nIn this context, it is essential to acknowledge that the increasing demand for cleaner energy sources and stricter environmental regulations will likely drive up coal prices in the coming years. This trend is expected to be particularly pronounced in regions with high carbon-reduction targets, such as Europe, where coal utilization has been ostensibly discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme.\n\nMoreover, the report highlights the critical role of China and India in driving global coal consumption over the next five years. As these countries continue to experience rapid economic growth, their energy demands are expected to increase significantly, leading to a surge in coal imports. This trend is likely to have far-reaching consequences for the environment, as coal is the fossil fuel with the highest carbon emissions.\n\nIn conclusion, the escalating demand for coal poses significant risks to the climate and human societies. To mitigate these impacts, it is essential to implement corrective measures, such as increasing the carbon price and promoting cleaner technologies like renewable energy. By doing so, we can reduce demand for coal, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and promote a more sustainable future for all.\n\nThe IEA's Medium-Term Coal Market Report underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to address the challenges posed by coal consumption.

One of the pivotal factors driving the surge in coal consumption has been the unprecedented increase in shale gas utilization in the US, which has led to a paradigmatic shift in global energy dynamics and necessitates a reevaluation of our current understanding of the complex interplay between fossil fuel markets and environmental sustainability.\n\nResearch conducted by the International Energy Agency (IEA) reveals that coal usage is escalating globally, even in nations and regions with carbon-reduction targets, except for the US, where shale gas has supplanted coal as the preferred energy source due to its lower emissions profile and more favorable market conditions. This phenomenon has been observed in various sectors, including industry and transportation, where the adoption of cleaner technologies and alternative fuels is increasingly being driven by economic imperatives.\n\nThe decline of coal consumption in the US has contributed to a decrease in global coal prices, rendering it more attractive, even in Europe, where coal utilization was ostensibly discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme. However, this trend is likely to be short-lived, as the increasing demand for cleaner energy sources and stricter environmental regulations are expected to drive up coal prices in the coming years.\n\nMaria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, posits that coal consumption will continue to rise annually and, if no corrective measures are implemented, coal will surpass oil as a dominant energy source within a decade. Coal is an abundant resource, widely available in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be extracted at a relatively low cost. According to the IEA's Medium-Term Coal Market Report, China and India will drive global coal consumption over the next five years, with India poised to surpass the US as the second-largest consumer.\n\nChina is the largest coal importer, while Indonesia is the largest exporter. The report forecasts that the world will burn 1.2 billion more tonnes of coal annually by 2017 compared to current levels. As the fossil fuel with the highest carbon emissions, coal significantly contributes to climate change, particularly when burned in antiquated, inefficient power plants. When these facilities are not equipped with specialized scrubbing equipment to remove pollutants, coal can also produce sulfur emissions \u2013 the primary cause of acid rain \u2013 and mercury and soot-particle pollution.\n\nVan der Hoeven suggests that without a high carbon price to deter coal consumption and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable energy, only competition from lower-priced gas can reduce demand for coal.

This trend is expected to be particularly pronounced in regions with high carbon-reduction targets, such as Europe, where coal utilization has been ostensibly discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme.\n\nMoreover, the report highlights the critical role of China and India in driving global coal consumption over the next five years.
