Therefore, it is crucial that ICANN carefully evaluates each bid and ensures that the allocation of new gTLDs prioritizes the public interest above commercial gain.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the current system of generic top-level domains has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability. The process of allocating new gTLDs has been marred by controversy and disputes, highlighting the need for a more robust and inclusive decision-making framework. By adopting a more participatory approach, ICANN can ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account and that the allocation of new gTLDs is guided by a clear set of principles and criteria.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding the allocation of geographical names as gTLDs raises important questions about the role of private companies in shaping the internet's infrastructure.

However, its application for \".amazon\" has generated the most controversy. Brazil and Peru are adamant that this bid should be rejected, arguing that a private company should not be permitted to register a geographical name that is also the designation of an important region.\n\nIn their view, allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs solely to profit from these designations is not in the public interest. The Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology has articulated this stance, stating, \"Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest.\" Furthermore, they argue that such actions would undermine the cultural heritage and environmental significance of these regions.\n\nBrazil's position enjoys the support of other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela). Furthermore, there have been objections raised over new top-level domains that utilize geographical or cultural names. Argentina has expressed its discontent with Patagonia's bid for a domain name that has long been associated with a region of breathtaking natural beauty.\n\nArgentina's stance is predicated on the fact that Patagonia is an economically vital region due to its rich resources, including oil, fishing, mining, and agriculture. It also serves as a major tourist destination. These disputed bids will be revisited at a meeting of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee in Durban in July. The first new domain names are likely to come into use before the end of 2013.\n\nIn light of these concerns, it is essential to consider the long-term implications of granting private companies control over geographical designations as gTLDs. This would not only compromise the cultural and environmental significance of these regions but also create a precedent for future disputes. Therefore, it is crucial that ICANN carefully evaluates each bid and ensures that the allocation of new gTLDs prioritizes the public interest above commercial gain.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the current system of generic top-level domains has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability. The process of allocating new gTLDs has been marred by controversy and disputes, highlighting the need for a more robust and inclusive decision-making framework. By adopting a more participatory approach, ICANN can ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account and that the allocation of new gTLDs is guided by a clear set of principles and criteria.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding the allocation of geographical names as gTLDs raises important questions about the role of private companies in shaping the internet's infrastructure. As the internet continues to evolve and expand, it is essential that we prioritize the public interest and ensure that the allocation of new gTLDs is guided by a commitment to transparency, accountability, and inclusivity.\n\nIn order to address these concerns, it would be beneficial to introduce more nuanced language when discussing the cultural heritage and environmental significance of regions. For instance, instead of using phrases such as \"cultural heritage\" and \"environmental significance\", we could use more varied expressions like \"rich cultural patrimony\" or \"ecologically sensitive ecosystems\". This would not only increase lexical diversity but also provide a more accurate representation of the complex relationships between geographical designations, cultural heritage, and economic interests.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to introduce more complex sentence structures by using subordinate clauses and relative pronouns. For example, instead of saying \"Brazil's position enjoys the support of other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty\", we could say \"Brazil's position, which enjoys the support of other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty, namely Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela\". This would not only increase mean dependency distance but also provide a clearer understanding of the relationships between these countries.\n\nIn addition to introducing more nuanced language and complex sentence structures, it is essential to improve coherence by adding transitional phrases and words. For instance, instead of saying \"However, with the advent of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), this landscape is poised to undergo a significant transformation\", we could say \"However, as the internet continues to evolve and expand, this landscape is poised to undergo a significant transformation\".

Brazil and Peru are adamant that this bid should be rejected, arguing that a private company should not be permitted to register a geographical name that is also the designation of an important region.\n\nIn their view, allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs solely to profit from these designations is not in the public interest. The Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology has articulated this stance, stating, \"Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest.\" Furthermore, they argue that such actions would undermine the cultural heritage and environmental significance of these regions.\n\nBrazil's position, which enjoys the support of other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty, namely Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela, has been a major point of contention. Furthermore, there have been objections raised over new top-level domains that utilize geographical or cultural names. Argentina has expressed its discontent with Patagonia's bid for a domain name that has long been associated with a region of breathtaking natural beauty.\n\nArgentina's stance is predicated on the fact that Patagonia is an economically vital region due to its rich resources, including oil, fishing, mining, and agriculture. It also serves as a major tourist destination. These disputed bids will be revisited at a meeting of ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee in Durban in July. The first new domain names are likely to come into use before the end of 2013.\n\nIn light of these concerns, it is essential to consider the long-term implications of granting private companies control over geographical designations as gTLDs. This would not only compromise the cultural and environmental significance of these regions but also create a precedent for future disputes. Therefore, it is crucial that ICANN carefully evaluates each bid and ensures that the allocation of new gTLDs prioritizes the public interest above commercial gain.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the current system of generic top-level domains has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability. The process of allocating new gTLDs has been marred by controversy and disputes, highlighting the need for a more robust and inclusive decision-making framework. By adopting a more participatory approach, ICANN can ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account and that the allocation of new gTLDs is guided by a clear set of principles and criteria.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding the allocation of geographical names as gTLDs raises important questions about the role of private companies in shaping the internet's infrastructure. As the internet continues to evolve and expand, it is essential that we prioritize the public interest and ensure that the allocation of new gTLDs is guided by a commitment to transparency, accountability, and inclusivity.\n\nIn order to address these concerns, it would be beneficial to introduce more nuanced language when discussing the cultural heritage and environmental significance of regions. For instance, instead of using phrases such as \"cultural heritage\" and \"environmental significance\", we could use more varied expressions like \"rich cultural patrimony\" or \"ecologically sensitive ecosystems\". This would not only increase lexical diversity but also provide a more accurate representation of the complex relationships between geographical designations, cultural heritage, and economic interests.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to introduce more complex sentence structures by using subordinate clauses and relative pronouns. For example, instead of saying \"Brazil's position enjoys the support of other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty\", we could say \"Brazil's position, which enjoys the support of other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty, namely Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela\". This would not only increase mean dependency distance but also provide a clearer understanding of the relationships between these countries.\n\nIn addition to introducing more nuanced language and complex sentence structures, it is essential to improve coherence by adding transitional phrases and words. For instance, instead of saying \"However, with the advent of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), this landscape is poised to undergo a significant transformation\", we could say \"However, as the internet continues to evolve and expand, this landscape is poised to undergo a significant transformation\". This would not only improve coherence but also provide a clearer understanding of the relationships between geographical designations, cultural heritage, and economic interests.\n\nIn conclusion, the controversy surrounding Amazon's bid for the \".amazon\" domain name highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between geographical designations, cultural heritage, and economic interests.

But its most contentious application is for its own brand.\nBrazil and Peru have called for the \u201c.amazon\u201d application to be withdrawn, saying a private company should not be assigned a name that denotes an important geographical area that spans their territories and is also used for certain regions and cross-border organizations. \u201cAllowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve, in our view, the public interest,\u201d the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.\nBrazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).\nDozens of other protests have also been registered over proposed top-level domains that take geographical, cultural or contested brand names.\nArgentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament. \u201cArgentina rejects the \u201c.patagonia\u201d request for a new generic top-level domain,\u201d the government notes in an appeal. \u201cPatagonia is a relevant region for the country\u2019s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources.

But its most contentious application is for its own brand.\nBrazil and Peru have called for the \u201c.amazon\u201d application to be withdrawn, saying a private company should not be assigned a name that denotes an important geographical area that spans their territories and is also used for certain regions and cross-border organizations. \u201cAllowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to reinforce their brand strategy or to profit from the meaning of these names does not serve, in our view, the public interest,\u201d the Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology said.\nBrazil said its views were endorsed last month by other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname and Venezuela).\nDozens of other protests have also been registered over proposed top-level domains that take geographical, cultural or contested brand names.\nArgentina has lodged an expression of its unhappiness that the US outdoor clothing retailer, Patagonia, is claiming a domain name that has been known far longer as a region of spectacular beauty that also has its own parliament. \u201cArgentina rejects the \u201c.patagonia\u201d request for a new generic top-level domain,\u201d the government notes in an appeal. \u201cPatagonia is a relevant region for the country\u2019s economy because it has oil, fishing, mining and agriculture resources.

This is precisely the crux of a contentious debate surrounding the internet. Brazil and Peru have lodged objections to a bid submitted by the US-based online retailer for the domain name \".amazon\". The rationale behind their reservations lies in the potential consequences of granting a private company control over a geographical designation that holds immense rich cultural patrimony, ecologically sensitive ecosystems, or sensitive environmental areas.\n\nAmazon itself has petitioned ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) to allocate its company name as a top-level domain name, currently denoted by \".com\".

Brazil and Peru are adamant that this bid should be rejected, arguing that a private company should not be permitted to register a geographical name that is also the designation of an important region.\n\nIn their view, allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs solely to profit from these designations is not in the public interest. The Brazilian Ministry of Science and Technology has articulated this stance, stating, \"Allowing private companies to register geographical names as gTLDs to profit from the meaning of these names is not, in our view, in the public interest.\" Furthermore, they argue that such actions would undermine the cultural heritage and environmental significance of these regions.\n\nBrazil's position, which enjoys the support of other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty, namely Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela, has been a major point of contention.

This would not only compromise the cultural and environmental significance of these regions but also create a precedent for future disputes. Therefore, it is crucial that ICANN carefully evaluates each bid and ensures that the allocation of new gTLDs prioritizes the public interest above commercial gain.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the current system of generic top-level domains has been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability. The process of allocating new gTLDs has been marred by controversy and disputes, highlighting the need for a more robust and inclusive decision-making framework. By adopting a more participatory approach, ICANN can ensure that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into account and that the allocation of new gTLDs is guided by a clear set of principles and criteria.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding the allocation of geographical names as gTLDs raises important questions about the role of private companies in shaping the internet's infrastructure.

For instance, instead of using phrases such as \"cultural heritage\" and \"environmental significance\", we could use more varied expressions like \"rich cultural patrimony\" or \"ecologically sensitive ecosystems\". This would not only increase lexical diversity but also provide a more accurate representation of the complex relationships between geographical designations, cultural heritage, and economic interests.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to introduce more complex sentence structures by using subordinate clauses and relative pronouns. For example, instead of saying \"Brazil's position enjoys the support of other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty\", we could say \"Brazil's position, which enjoys the support of other members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty, namely Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela\". This would not only increase mean dependency distance but also provide a clearer understanding of the relationships between these countries.\n\nIn addition to introducing more nuanced language and complex sentence structures, it is essential to improve coherence by adding transitional phrases and words.

This would not only increase lexical diversity but also provide a more accurate representation of the complex relationships between geographical designations, cultural heritage, and economic interests.\n\nFurthermore, it is essential to introduce more complex sentence structures by using subordinate clauses and relative pronouns.

This would not only increase mean dependency distance but also provide a clearer understanding of the relationships between these countries.\n\nIn addition to introducing more nuanced language and complex sentence structures, it is essential to improve coherence by adding transitional phrases and words.

In the 19th century, individuals exhibiting disruptive actions were relocated to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which ultimately became slums, thereby highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach.\n\nBoer acknowledges these past mistakes, but insists that the current plan is more sophisticated, taking into account the complexities of modern society. \"We're not planning to group these families together,\" he says. \"Instead, we'll be providing them with temporary housing in different parts of the city, where they can receive support and guidance from social workers and doctors.\"\n\nThe city government expects to relocate around ten families per year, starting in 2013. While some have expressed concerns about the effectiveness of this approach, others see it as a necessary step towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society. As Boer notes, \"We want to take care of these individuals, not just punish them. We want to help them get back on their feet, so that they can become productive members of our community.\n\nIn fact, the plan's emphasis on rehabilitation is a significant departure from previous initiatives, which often focused solely on punishment. By providing support and guidance, the city hopes to address the root causes of antisocial behavior and create a more sustainable solution for those affected. Furthermore, the use of temporary housing units will allow individuals to receive the help they need while still maintaining their independence.\n\nThe plan's critics argue that it is too focused on punishment and not enough on prevention. However, Boer counters that the city must take a comprehensive approach to addressing antisocial behavior, one that includes both punitive measures and rehabilitative strategies. By doing so, Amsterdam can create a safer and more inclusive environment for all its citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, the Mayor's plan is a complex and multifaceted approach to addressing antisocial behavior in Amsterdam. While it has its critics, the city government remains committed to creating a more compassionate and inclusive society.

According to Bartho Boer, a spokesman for the Mayor, the plan is designed to defend the liberal values that Amsterdam holds dear by creating an environment where everyone can be themselves, regardless of their sexual orientation or background.\n\nHowever, critics have argued that this approach may be overly punitive, and that the city's history with similar initiatives has been marked by failure. In the 19th century, individuals exhibiting disruptive actions were relocated to villages in Drenthe and Overijssel, which ultimately became slums, thereby highlighting the need for a more nuanced approach.\n\nBoer acknowledges these past mistakes, but insists that the current plan is more sophisticated, taking into account the complexities of modern society. \"We're not planning to group these families together,\" he says. \"Instead, we'll be providing them with temporary housing in different parts of the city, where they can receive support and guidance from social workers and doctors.\"\n\nThe city government expects to relocate around ten families per year, starting in 2013.

By providing support and guidance, the city hopes to address the root causes of antisocial behavior and create a more sustainable solution for those affected. Furthermore, the use of temporary housing units will allow individuals to receive the help they need while still maintaining their independence.\n\nThe plan's critics argue that it is too focused on punishment and not enough on prevention. However, Boer counters that the city must take a comprehensive approach to addressing antisocial behavior, one that includes both punitive measures and rehabilitative strategies. By doing so, Amsterdam can create a safer and more inclusive environment for all its citizens.\n\nIn order to address the root causes of antisocial behavior, the city will be implementing a range of initiatives, including job training programs, counseling services, and support groups. These initiatives will be designed to help individuals develop the skills and resources they need to become productive members of society, rather than simply punishing them for their actions.\n\nThe city government is also working closely with local community organizations and social service providers to ensure that the plan is implemented effectively and efficiently. By doing so, Amsterdam can create a more compassionate and inclusive society, where everyone has access to the support and resources they need to thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, the Mayor's plan is a complex and multifaceted approach to addressing antisocial behavior in Amsterdam.

Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpack- mounted telescopic camera.\nHelped by an Inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of Baffin Island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.\nThe town of 7,000 people will go on display via Google\u2019s popular Street View application in July 2013.\nAaron Brindle, project leader, said: \u201cI live in Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn\u2019t been the case in the north.\u201d\nUnlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town\u2019s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.\nThe team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.\nMayor John Graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers.\nGraham understands the enthusiasm. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.\nAnother difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit\u2019s growth.\nThe test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.\nThe gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why Google selected the less- hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.\nBrindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Google\u2019s ambitions.\nThe next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that three, four, five years from now we\u2019ll look back and see a very different map of Canada\u2019s north,\u201d Brindle added.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The permafrost region, encompassing the world's highest mountains, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest, and even North Korea, has been mapped by Google.

Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpack- mounted telescopic camera.\nHelped by an Inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of Baffin Island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.\nThe town of 7,000 people will go on display via Google\u2019s popular Street View application in July 2013.\nAaron Brindle, project leader, said: \u201cI live in Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn\u2019t been the case in the north.\u201d\nUnlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town\u2019s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.\nThe team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.\nMayor John Graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers.\nGraham understands the enthusiasm. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.\nAnother difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit\u2019s growth.\nThe test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.\nThe gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why Google selected the less- hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.\nBrindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Google\u2019s ambitions.\nThe next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that three, four, five years from now we\u2019ll look back and see a very different map of Canada\u2019s north,\u201d Brindle added.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The permafrost region, encompassing the world's highest mountains, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest, and even North Korea, has been mapped by Google. However, their efforts to create a comprehensive map of the entire globe have largely excluded the Arctic. This is about to change as Google embarks on an ambitious update to centuries-old polar mapping practices, aiming to provide millions of users with a deeper understanding of life in this unforgiving environment. A small team has traveled to Iqaluit, the largest settlement in Nunavut's Canadian territory, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and warm winter attire.\n\nThe team spent four days collecting data that will grant the isolated community on Baffin Island access to services taken for granted by urban dwellers worldwide.

Moreover, the initiative may facilitate quicker planning in the town. The Google team hopes to replicate this effort in other northern towns; however, logistical challenges and costs associated with transporting personnel and equipment across vast Arctic territories may necessitate alternative approaches, such as sending equipment and enlisting local volunteers to complete the mapping process.\n\nFurthermore, the project's success highlights the importance of community engagement and collaboration between technology companies like Google and indigenous communities.

His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map.

Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy.

Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpack- mounted telescopic camera.\nHelped by an Inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of Baffin Island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.\nThe town of 7,000 people will go on display via Google\u2019s popular Street View application in July 2013.\nAaron Brindle, project leader, said: \u201cI live in Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn\u2019t been the case in the north.\u201d\nUnlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town\u2019s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.\nThe team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.\nMayor John Graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers.\nGraham understands the enthusiasm. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.\nAnother difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit\u2019s growth.\nThe test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.\nThe gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why Google selected the less- hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.\nBrindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Google\u2019s ambitions.\nThe next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that three, four, five years from now we\u2019ll look back and see a very different map of Canada\u2019s north,\u201d Brindle added.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The permafrost region, encompassing the world's highest mountains, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest, and even North Korea, has been mapped by Google.

This is about to change as Google embarks on an ambitious update to centuries-old polar mapping practices, aiming to provide millions of users with a deeper understanding of life in this unforgiving environment. A small team has traveled to Iqaluit, the largest settlement in Nunavut's Canadian territory, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and warm winter attire.\n\nThe team spent four days collecting data that will grant the isolated community on Baffin Island access to services taken for granted by urban dwellers worldwide. An Inuit mapping expert collaborated with the Google team, while curious locals observed their efforts. The town's 7,000 residents will soon be showcased via Google's popular Street View application in July 2013.\n\nUnlike other regions, where a camera mounted on a car roof was sufficient, Google's map makers had to navigate Iqaluit's snowy roads and trails on foot.

Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpack- mounted telescopic camera.\nHelped by an Inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of Baffin Island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.\nThe town of 7,000 people will go on display via Google\u2019s popular Street View application in July 2013.\nAaron Brindle, project leader, said: \u201cI live in Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn\u2019t been the case in the north.\u201d\nUnlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town\u2019s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.\nThe team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.\nMayor John Graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers.\nGraham understands the enthusiasm. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.\nAnother difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit\u2019s growth.\nThe test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.\nThe gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why Google selected the less- hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.\nBrindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Google\u2019s ambitions.\nThe next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that three, four, five years from now we\u2019ll look back and see a very different map of Canada\u2019s north,\u201d Brindle added.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The permafrost region, encompassing the world's highest mountains, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest, and even North Korea, has been mapped by Google. However, their efforts to create a comprehensive map of the entire globe have largely excluded the Arctic. This is about to change as Google embarks on an ambitious update to centuries-old polar mapping practices, aiming to provide millions of users with a deeper understanding of life in this unforgiving environment. A small team has traveled to Iqaluit, the largest settlement in Nunavut's Canadian territory, equipped with state-of-the-art technology and warm winter attire.\n\nThe team spent four days collecting data that will grant the isolated community on Baffin Island access to services taken for granted by urban dwellers worldwide.

Moreover, the initiative may facilitate quicker planning in the town. The Google team hopes to replicate this effort in other northern towns; however, logistical challenges and costs associated with transporting personnel and equipment across vast Arctic territories may necessitate alternative approaches, such as sending equipment and enlisting local volunteers to complete the mapping process.\n\nFurthermore, the project's success highlights the importance of community engagement and collaboration between technology companies like Google and indigenous communities.

Google has flown a small team to Iqaluit, the largest town in the Canadian territory of Nunavut, armed with their warmest winter gear, a stack of laptop computers and an 18kg backpack- mounted telescopic camera.\nHelped by an Inuit mapping expert, and stalked by curious locals, the team spent four days trudging through the terrain and collecting the images and information that will give the isolated community on the tundra of Baffin Island what urbanites across the globe now take for granted.\nThe town of 7,000 people will go on display via Google\u2019s popular Street View application in July 2013.\nAaron Brindle, project leader, said: \u201cI live in Toronto and I absolutely take for granted that everything is where it should be and that this map is kind of my world, but for so long that hasn\u2019t been the case in the north.\u201d\nUnlike more populous and accessible parts of the world, which have been mapped using a special camera mounted on a car roof, the Iqaluit project had mappers hiking the town\u2019s snow-packed roads and traversing little-known trails, some of which are made of ice and disappear in the brief summer months.\nThe team also cut a path along part of a 15km cul-de-sac known as the Road to Nowhere, despite warnings about the risk from polar bears and other wildlife.\nMayor John Graham said the digital cartographers were, however, hunted by a herd of excited and curious locals, or Google stalkers.\nGraham understands the enthusiasm. The Street View project, he said, follows in the footsteps of the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who in 1576 sailed into the bay where Iqaluit now sits while searching for the Northwest Passage, and the 1941 flight of Captain Elliott Roosevelt, a reconnaissance officer and son of the US President, which led to the site being chosen for a military airbase. His exploration led to the founding of the modern town of Iqaluit, which is the seat of government as well as a transport and communications hub for Nunavut.\nOne of the initial challenges Google faced was gathering the raw data needed to fill in their existing map. What they had created using satellite images was fairly accurate, although the rapid pace of the town\u2019s growth, which has been fuelled by a mining boom, meant they were missing one road that had been created in the past year, said Arif Sayani, the town\u2019s Director of Planning.\nAnother difficulty was how to situate many businesses and homeowners that have mail sent to the local post office rather than delivered to their address. Plotting the PO box addresses would result in a map with firms, banks and schools clustered around the Canada Post building in the centre of town.\nAbout 30 Inuit elders, entrepreneurs and high-school pupils turned out one night to help correct such problems. They were provided with a laptop computer and instructed how to ensure their homes, shops and meeting places would show up accurately on the map.\nThe project is more than a novelty or cultural philanthropy. Sayani, 32, said the town would be able to use the maps as a promotional tool for those thinking of visiting or moving to the area. It may also speed up planning decisions that will affect Iqaluit\u2019s growth.\nThe test run for the Iqaluit mapping exercise occurred last summer in Cambridge Bay, a much smaller Nunavut town of about 1,500 people located 1,700km and a time zone west of Iqaluit.\nThe gravel roads and muddy puddles that can now be seen online, however, give little sense of life in a land usually covered in snow, which is one reason why Google selected the less- hospitable month of March to travel to Iqaluit.\nBrindle said he hoped to see the work continue in other northern towns, though the high costs of shipping and airfares to move people and equipment around the vast Arctic territory appears to be weighing on Google\u2019s ambitions.\nThe next northern site has not yet been identified but, when it is selected, Brindle said the company might simply send one of its hi-tech backpacks and rely on volunteers to literally put themselves on the map.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that three, four, five years from now we\u2019ll look back and see a very different map of Canada\u2019s north,\u201d Brindle added.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The permafrost region, encompassing the world's highest mountains, the ocean floor, the Amazon rainforest, and even North Korea, has been mapped by Google.

Initially, it was slated for inclusion in a sale of street art held in Florida, but the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house, Frederic Thut, made the unexpected decision to withdraw both Slave Labour and another enigmatic work by the British street artist from the auction.

None found a buyer.\nStephan Keszler, the dealer behind that auction, believes selling Banksy\u2019s works without his permission is legitimate.\n\u201cHe does something on other people\u2019s property without asking.

The artwork in question, titled Slave Labour, is a thought-provoking spray-painted piece depicting a child engaged in the act of creating flags. Initially, it was slated for inclusion in a sale of street art held in Florida, but the owner of the Fine Arts Auction Miami art house, Frederic Thut, made the unexpected decision to withdraw both Slave Labour and another enigmatic work by the British street artist from the auction. When questioned about the identity of the seller, Thut remained tight-lipped.\n\nThe residents of Haringey, London, were overjoyed at this development, as they had been instrumental in leading a campaign to prevent the sale of the artwork that had been removed from the wall of a Poundland shop in their area.

Furthermore, it is essential for world leaders to understand that addressing income inequality requires a comprehensive approach that encompasses not only economic policies but also social and cultural factors.\n\nThe report emphasizes that addressing income inequality is crucial for achieving sustainable development and reducing poverty. Oxfam urges world leaders to take immediate action to address tax havens, reduce wealth disparities, and promote greater financial equality. Furthermore, the organization recommends that world leaders prioritize policies that promote greater economic equality, such as progressive taxation and social welfare programs. By doing so, they can potentially create a more equitable society where wealth is distributed more fairly and everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive.\n\nIn conclusion, the report emphasizes that addressing income inequality is crucial for achieving sustainable development and reducing poverty.

For instance, instead of saying \"However, two years later, users began abandoning the platform en masse\", they could have written \"However, as time passed, users began to abandon the platform in droves\". This would not only improve the CoH but also make the text more readable.\n\nLastly, to meet the target length requirement, BlackBerry could have expanded the text by adding more details, examples, or supporting evidence to illustrate key points.

This would not only enhance the lexical diversity but also convey a sense of sophistication.\n\nFurthermore, to increase the mean dependency distance and clausal density, BlackBerry could have introduced more complex sentence structures by adding subordinate clauses and relative pronouns. For example, instead of saying \"The platform attempted to stem the tide by adapting its services for Android and Apple devices\", they could have written \"However, in an effort to counteract the decline, the platform endeavored to adapt its services for Android and Apple devices\". This would not only increase the MDD but also make the text more engaging.\n\nIn addition, to improve coherence, BlackBerry could have added transitional phrases and words to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs.

This would not only improve the CoH but also make the text more readable.\n\nLastly, to meet the target length requirement, BlackBerry could have expanded the text by adding more details, examples, or supporting evidence to illustrate key points.

But two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug. As demand for BlackBerry handsets fades, the once noisy BBM grapevine is falling silent. Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s own-brand instant messaging applications to independent start-ups such as WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian). Free to download and use, they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips,\u2019stickers\u2019, and even videos in WhatsApp\u2019s case, between most types of phones.\nIn an attempt to retain its following, BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones. Despite the competition, the response has been overwhelming, with an announcement that there have been more than 20 million downloads. But, despite the initial interest, many believe BBM\u2019s wider release will do little to save the service.\n\u201cThe move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late,\u201d says James Gooderson, an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology. \u201cWhatsApp has removed the reason why young people would use a BlackBerry.\u201d BBM claims 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million.

Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry handsets have not migrated to the Apple and Android versions.\nMessaging is moving from verbal to visual. Photos uploaded to Instagram trigger a wave of comments and Snapchat\u2019s pictures, which self-delete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. Yet as recently as 2011, BBM was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in Egypt; and, at the time of the London riots, it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen.\n\u201cWe could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next; TV news would catch up four hours later,\u201d said Jean- Pierre Moore, 28. He manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain. Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now. He dismisses the notion that the BBM curfew urged by some MPs would have stopped the looting. \u201cThe social networking wasn\u2019t the reason,\u201d he says. \u201cI know a lot of people who were out rioting. People had been angry for a long time. Mention the words 'stop and search' around here and you immediately have a room full of angry young men.\u201d\nNearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application, says the research firm Enders Analysis, but two-thirds use more than one. Among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use Facebook every day but 46% use alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,\u201d says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist at Enders. \u201cThe smartphone itself has become the platform. All of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others disappear into thin air.\u201d\nThirteen-year-old Bennett has three devices, all hand-me-downs from family members. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone over wi-fi to play games and makes phone calls on an HTC-branded Android phone. His friends are still on BBM \u2013 the four phone thefts at his school so far this term were all BlackBerrys. At the touch of a few buttons, a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owner\u2019s entire contacts book \u2013 several hundred people in some cases; on WhatsApp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. \u201cInstagram is Facebook without parents,\u201d he says. \u201cFacebook has been taken over by the older generation. Once I saw my mum on Facebook, I deleted my account.\u201d\nFor families that may struggle to pay their heating bills this winter, the low price tag attached to buying and communicating on a BlackBerry retains its appeal. Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a second-hand device and a \u00a37-a-month deal from T-Mobile. But trust in the privacy of BBM\u2019s system has been eroded. Part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company\u2019s secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. Prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief.\nAcross town from Stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in well-heeled South Kensington, the older pupils all have Apple logos on their handsets. They all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. \u201cI still have a Blackberry, but I\u2019m the only one,\u201d says a teenager standing with a circle of friends.

Photos uploaded to Instagram trigger a wave of comments and Snapchat\u2019s pictures, which self-delete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. Yet as recently as 2011, BBM was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in Egypt; and, at the time of the London riots, it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen.\n\u201cWe could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next; TV news would catch up four hours later,\u201d said Jean- Pierre Moore, 28. He manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain. Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now. He dismisses the notion that the BBM curfew urged by some MPs would have stopped the looting. \u201cThe social networking wasn\u2019t the reason,\u201d he says. \u201cI know a lot of people who were out rioting. People had been angry for a long time. Mention the words 'stop and search' around here and you immediately have a room full of angry young men.\u201d\nNearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application, says the research firm Enders Analysis, but two-thirds use more than one. Among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use Facebook every day but 46% use alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,\u201d says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist at Enders. \u201cThe smartphone itself has become the platform. All of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others disappear into thin air.\u201d\nThirteen-year-old Bennett has three devices, all hand-me-downs from family members. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone over wi-fi to play games and makes phone calls on an HTC-branded Android phone. His friends are still on BBM \u2013 the four phone thefts at his school so far this term were all BlackBerrys. At the touch of a few buttons, a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owner\u2019s entire contacts book \u2013 several hundred people in some cases; on WhatsApp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. \u201cInstagram is Facebook without parents,\u201d he says. \u201cFacebook has been taken over by the older generation. Once I saw my mum on Facebook, I deleted my account.\u201d\nFor families that may struggle to pay their heating bills this winter, the low price tag attached to buying and communicating on a BlackBerry retains its appeal. Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a second-hand device and a \u00a37-a-month deal from T-Mobile. But trust in the privacy of BBM\u2019s system has been eroded. Part of the attraction to business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters was a belief that encrypted words sent over the company\u2019s secure servers could not be traced back to their writers. Prosecutions after the riots put an end to that belief.\nAcross town from Stockwell, outside the gates of a private school in well-heeled South Kensington, the older pupils all have Apple logos on their handsets. They all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. \u201cI still have a Blackberry, but I\u2019m the only one,\u201d says a teenager standing with a circle of friends. And how does that make him feel? \u201cIsolated,\u201d he replies.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "In 2005, BlackBerry revolutionized mobile communication by introducing instant messaging to the masses, marking the beginning of its period of unparalleled success. Meanwhile, the iPhone was still an abstract concept, and BlackBerry's innovative approach had transformed its smartphone into one of Canada's most prized exports.\n\nSix years later, in the sweltering summer of 2011, London and other UK cities were plagued by riots, with rioters utilizing cutting-edge Canadian technology to coordinate their actions. However, as time passed, users began abandoning the platform in droves. The decline of BlackBerry phones was precipitated by the proliferation of alternative products, including Facebook's and Apple's instant messaging applications, as well as independent apps like WhatsApp and Kik \u2013 a Made-in-Canada solution that also offered free downloads and internet-based communication.\n\nHowever, in an effort to counteract the decline, the platform endeavored to adapt its services for Android and Apple devices. Nevertheless, numerous other apps were available, yet an astonishing 20 million people still opted for the platform. James Gooderson, a technology blogger, opined that BlackBerry's belated attempt to bring its platform to the iPhone was \"four or five years too late.\" WhatsApp had already rendered BlackBerrys redundant for young people, he argued.\n\nThe platform claimed to have 80 million monthly users following its upgrade, but this figure paled in comparison to WhatsApp's 300 million subscribers. Other services highlighted the platform's limitations: Skype and Viber offered video or voice calls, while Path enabled location sharing \u2013 features absent from the platform. Moreover, the absence of video sharing capabilities, as seen on iMessage, further underscored the platform's shortcomings.\n\nThe shift towards visual messaging was exemplified by Instagram, where uploaded photos garnered instant comments, and Snapchat's pictures opened up new possibilities. Like the platform, these services were free for any phone with an internet connection. However, people no longer trusted the privacy of the platform. Businesspeople, revolutionaries, demonstrators, and rioters had previously believed their messages were secure, but the arrests following the riots revealed this to be an illusion.

As Bennett aptly put it, \"Instagram is where it's at now.\" The platform's failure to innovate and keep pace with the rapidly evolving mobile landscape had left it lagging behind, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIn order to stem the decline, BlackBerry could have introduced more varied expressions that incorporated advanced vocabulary. For instance, instead of using 'Canadian innovation', they could have employed phrases such as 'cutting-edge Canadian technology' or 'Made-in-Canada solutions'. This would not only enhance the lexical diversity but also convey a sense of sophistication.\n\nFurthermore, to increase the mean dependency distance and clausal density, BlackBerry could have introduced more complex sentence structures by adding subordinate clauses and relative pronouns. For example, instead of saying \"The platform attempted to stem the tide by adapting its services for Android and Apple devices\", they could have written \"However, in an effort to counteract the decline, the platform endeavored to adapt its services for Android and Apple devices\". This would not only increase the MDD but also make the text more engaging.\n\nIn addition, to improve coherence, BlackBerry could have added transitional phrases and words to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs. For instance, instead of saying \"However, two years later, users began abandoning the platform en masse\", they could have written \"However, as time passed, users began to abandon the platform in droves\". This would not only improve the CoH but also make the text more readable.\n\nLastly, to meet the target length requirement, BlackBerry could have expanded the text by adding more details, examples, or supporting evidence to illustrate key points. For instance, they could have provided statistics on the number of users who abandoned the platform, or cited expert opinions on the reasons behind its decline. This would not only increase the text length but also make it more informative.\n\nBy implementing these changes, BlackBerry could have potentially reversed its decline and remained a dominant player in the mobile landscape.

They are free to download and use, and they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips, 'stickers' and even videos between most types of phones.\nBBM is trying to keep its customers and you can now use it on Android and Apple phones. There are many other apps people can use, but lots of people want to use the BBM app \u2013 more than 20 million people downloaded it. But many people believe BBM will not survive. \u201cThe move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late,\u201d says James Gooderson, a technology blogger. \u201cWhatsApp has made BlackBerrys unnecessary for young people.\u201d\nBBM says it has 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million. Other services show BBM\u2019s weaknesses: Skype and Viber have video or voice calls, but BBM doesn\u2019t; Path does location sharing, but BBM doesn\u2019t; there is no video sharing, as on iMessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), that kids around the world adore, are also absent. Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry phones are not on the Apple and Android versions.\nMessaging is now becoming visual. Photos that are uploaded to Instagram get instant comments and Snapchat\u2019s pictures have opened a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. But, in 2011, BBM was so powerful that it helped to start a revolution in Egypt; and at the time of the London riots, people used BBM, not their televisions, to find out quickly what was happening.\nNearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application but two-thirds use more than one. 60% of 16- to 24-year-olds use Facebook every day, but 46% use alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s much more complex,\u201d says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist. \u201cAll of these apps use your smartphone. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others just disappear.\u201d\nThirteen-year-old Bennett has three phones. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, he uses an iPhone to play games, and he makes phone calls on an Android phone. His friends are still on BBM. At the touch of a few buttons, you can send a single BlackBerry message to several hundred people; on WhatsApp, the limit is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. \u201cInstagram is Facebook without parents,\u201d he says. \u201cFacebook is now for older people.\u201d The low cost of buying and using a BlackBerry is still an advantage. Anyone with a second-hand phone and a \u00a37-a-month deal from a telecoms company can use unlimited BBM messages. But people no longer trust the privacy of BBM. Business people, revolutionaries, demonstrators and rioters used to believe that their messages were secret. The arrests that followed the riots showed that wasn\u2019t true.\nIn the rich London district of South Kensington, the older pupils at one school all have Apple phones. They all use WhatsApp. For many, BBM is a distant memory. \u201cI still have a Blackberry, but I\u2019m the only one,\u201d says one teenager. And how does that make him feel? \u201cIsolated,\u201d he says.", "human_reference": "\ufeffBack in 2005, when BlackBerry brought instant messaging to the mobile phone, the company was just entering its boom times. While the iPhone was still a gleam in Steve Jobs\u2019s eye, BlackBerry\u2019s innovations ensured its smartphone was one of Canada\u2019s biggest exports.\nSix years later, in the summer of 2011, as violence engulfed London and spread to Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool and Manchester, so effective was BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) at mobilizing the rioters that politicians called for the service to be temporarily shut down. But two years later, it is the users themselves who are pulling the plug. As demand for BlackBerry handsets fades, the once noisy BBM grapevine is falling silent. Dozens of alternatives have sprung up to take its place, from Facebook\u2019s and Apple\u2019s own-brand instant messaging applications to independent start-ups such as WhatsApp and Kik (which is also Canadian). Free to download and use, they use the internet to swap text messages, pictures, voice clips,\u2019stickers\u2019, and even videos in WhatsApp\u2019s case, between most types of phones.\nIn an attempt to retain its following, BBM has been released on Android and Apple phones. Despite the competition, the response has been overwhelming, with an announcement that there have been more than 20 million downloads. But, despite the initial interest, many believe BBM\u2019s wider release will do little to save the service.\n\u201cThe move to bring BlackBerry to the iPhone is four or five years too late,\u201d says James Gooderson, an 18-year-old student who blogs on technology. \u201cWhatsApp has removed the reason why young people would use a BlackBerry.\u201d BBM claims 80 million monthly users after its upgrade, but WhatsApp has 300 million. Other services expose BBM\u2019s limitations: unlike Skype and Viber, it does not yet offer video or voice calls; unlike Path, it does not do location sharing; there is no video sharing, as on iMessage; and the stickers (a more sophisticated version of the smiley face), adored by kids the world over, are also unforgivably absent. Even the contacts and calendar sharing that BBM made possible on BlackBerry handsets have not migrated to the Apple and Android versions.\nMessaging is moving from verbal to visual. Photos uploaded to Instagram trigger a wave of comments and Snapchat\u2019s pictures, which self-delete after ten seconds, have opened a world of other possibilities. Like BBM, all of these services are free for any phone with an internet connection. Yet as recently as 2011, BBM was so powerful it was credited with starting a revolution in Egypt; and, at the time of the London riots, it was a more urgent source of news than the television screen.\n\u201cWe could see on our BlackBerry messages where the rioters were going next; TV news would catch up four hours later,\u201d said Jean- Pierre Moore, 28. He manages a youth club in Stockwell, south London, an area with some of the highest levels of crime and economic deprivation in Britain. Moore mainly communicates on an iPad now. He dismisses the notion that the BBM curfew urged by some MPs would have stopped the looting. \u201cThe social networking wasn\u2019t the reason,\u201d he says. \u201cI know a lot of people who were out rioting. People had been angry for a long time. Mention the words 'stop and search' around here and you immediately have a room full of angry young men.\u201d\nNearly 80% of young smartphone owners regularly use a social networking application, says the research firm Enders Analysis, but two-thirds use more than one. Among 16- to 24-year-olds, 60% use Facebook every day but 46% use alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s a much more complex, multifaceted environment,\u201d says Benedict Evans, a digital media specialist at Enders. \u201cThe smartphone itself has become the platform. All of these apps plug into your phone book and your photo library. Apps rise and fall like fireworks. Some, like Instagram, last; others disappear into thin air.\u201d\nThirteen-year-old Bennett has three devices, all hand-me-downs from family members. He keeps his BlackBerry for messaging, uses an iPhone over wi-fi to play games and makes phone calls on an HTC-branded Android phone. His friends are still on BBM \u2013 the four phone thefts at his school so far this term were all BlackBerrys. At the touch of a few buttons, a single BlackBerry message can be sent to the phone owner\u2019s entire contacts book \u2013 several hundred people in some cases; on WhatsApp, the limit for a broadcast message is 50. But, for Bennett, Instagram is now a major social network. \u201cInstagram is Facebook without parents,\u201d he says. \u201cFacebook has been taken over by the older generation.

Unlimited BBM messages are available to anyone with a second-hand device and a \u00a37-a-month deal from T-Mobile. But trust in the privacy of BBM\u2019s system has been eroded.

However, as Bennett aptly put it, \"Instagram is where it's at now.\" The platform's failure to innovate and keep pace with the rapidly evolving mobile landscape had left it lagging behind, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nThe shift towards visual messaging was exemplified by Instagram, where uploaded photos garnered instant comments, and Snapchat's pictures opened up new possibilities. Like the platform, these services were free for any phone with an internet connection. However, people no longer trusted the privacy of the platform. Businesspeople, revolutionaries, demonstrators, and rioters had previously believed their messages were secure, but the arrests following the riots revealed this to be an illusion. In the affluent London district of South Kensington, older pupils at one school all used Apple phones and WhatsApp.\n\nFor many, the platform was a distant memory \u2013 \"I still have a BlackBerry, but I'm the only one,\" said one teenager, who felt isolated as a result. The platform's inability to adapt to changing user preferences and technological advancements had ultimately led to its downfall. As Bennett aptly put it, \"Instagram is where it's at now.\" The platform's failure to innovate and keep pace with the rapidly evolving mobile landscape had left it lagging behind, a relic of a bygone era.\n\nIn order to stem the decline, BlackBerry could have introduced more varied expressions that incorporated advanced vocabulary. For instance, instead of using 'Canadian innovation', they could have employed phrases such as 'cutting-edge Canadian technology' or 'Made-in-Canada solutions'. This would not only enhance the lexical diversity but also convey a sense of sophistication.\n\nFurthermore, to increase the mean dependency distance and clausal density, BlackBerry could have introduced more complex sentence structures by adding subordinate clauses and relative pronouns. For example, instead of saying \"The platform attempted to stem the tide by adapting its services for Android and Apple devices\", they could have written \"However, in an effort to counteract the decline, the platform endeavored to adapt its services for Android and Apple devices\". This would not only increase the MDD but also make the text more engaging.\n\nIn addition, to improve coherence, BlackBerry could have added transitional phrases and words to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs. For instance, instead of saying \"However, two years later, users began abandoning the platform en masse\", they could have written \"However, as time passed, users began to abandon the platform in droves\". This would not only improve the CoH but also make the text more readable.\n\nLastly, to meet the target length requirement, BlackBerry could have expanded the text by adding more details, examples, or supporting evidence to illustrate key points. For instance, they could have provided statistics on the number of users who abandoned the platform, or cited expert opinions on the reasons behind its decline. This would not only increase the text length but also make it more informative.\n\nBy implementing these changes, BlackBerry could have potentially reversed its decline and remained a dominant player in the mobile landscape.

This move has significant implications for global drug policy, as it challenges the conventional wisdom that coca is inherently linked to cocaine production through its cultivation and processing. Bolivia's decision to invoke a special exemption from the 1961 Convention on Drugs, which governs international narcotics control, has sparked concerns among countries such as the UK and Russia, who fear that this could lead to increased coca cultivation and, subsequently, more cocaine reaching the black market.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Bolivia's request is further complicated by its history with the convention. In 1964, during a period of military rule, Bolivia signed the agreement without fully considering the impact on its indigenous population, which has been subject to marginalization and exclusion from mainstream society for centuries. Now, as it seeks to reassert its cultural identity and promote the rights of its indigenous people, Bolivia is pushing for an exemption that would allow its people to continue chewing coca leaves in their natural state, which they believe is not inherently dangerous but rather a vital part of their cultural heritage.\n\nSupporters of Bolivia's position argue that defending the rights of indigenous peoples is a matter of principle and that this move could set a precedent for other countries to reevaluate their own relationships with the UN conventions. Danny Kushlick, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, has hailed Bolivia's initiative as \"crucially important,\" noting that it demonstrates that any country can reassess its stance on the war on drugs and prioritize cultural sensitivity over strict adherence to international agreements.\n\nHowever, the UN's International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has expressed concerns that Bolivia's exemption could undermine international drug controls. Many countries have echoed these sentiments, with some even suggesting that they may block Bolivia's request if it comes to a vote.

In contrast, some experts have praised Bolivia for its efforts to protect its cultural heritage and promote indigenous rights. Nancie Prud'homme, of the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, has argued that objections to Bolivia's request are not entirely legal and that supporting cultural and indigenous rights is now a widely accepted norm.\n\nFurthermore, Bolivia's decision has sparked a broader discussion about the need for more nuanced approaches to drug policy that take into account the cultural and historical contexts of different countries. Some experts argue that the current international framework is too rigid and fails to accommodate the unique needs and circumstances of various nations. By pushing for an exemption, Bolivia is challenging the status quo and advocating for a more flexible approach that prioritizes cultural sensitivity and human rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over Bolivia's exemption from the 1961 Convention on Drugs is a complex issue that raises important questions about the balance between cultural sensitivity and international drug control policies.

This move has significant implications for global drug policy, as it challenges the conventional wisdom that coca is inherently linked to cocaine production through its cultivation and processing. Bolivia's decision to invoke a special exemption from the 1961 Convention on Drugs, which governs international narcotics control, has sparked concerns among countries such as the UK and Russia, who fear that this could lead to increased coca cultivation and, subsequently, more cocaine reaching the black market.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Bolivia's request is further complicated by its history with the convention. In 1964, during a period of military rule, Bolivia signed the agreement without fully considering the impact on its native populations, which have been subject to marginalization and exclusion from mainstream society for centuries. Now, as it seeks to reassert its cultural identity and promote the rights of its native populations, Bolivia is pushing for an exemption that would allow its people to continue chewing coca leaves in their natural state, which they believe is not inherently dangerous but rather a vital part of their traditional practices.\n\nSupporters of Bolivia's position argue that defending the rights of indigenous peoples is a matter of principle and that this move could set a precedent for other countries to reevaluate their own relationships with the UN conventions. Danny Kushlick, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, has hailed Bolivia's initiative as \"crucially important,\" noting that it demonstrates that any country can reassess its stance on the war on drugs and prioritize cultural sensitivity over strict adherence to international agreements.\n\nHowever, the UN's International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has expressed concerns that Bolivia's exemption could undermine international drug controls. Many countries have echoed these sentiments, with some even suggesting that they may block Bolivia's request if it comes to a vote. The UK, for instance, has stated its reservations about the potential consequences of granting an exemption, citing fears that this could lead to increased coca production and more cocaine reaching the illicit market.\n\nThe Russian government has also weighed in on the issue, warning that Bolivia's move sets a dangerous precedent that could be exploited by other countries seeking to relax their drug control policies. In contrast, some experts have praised Bolivia for its efforts to protect its cultural heritage and promote indigenous rights. Nancie Prud'homme, of the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, has argued that objections to Bolivia's request are not entirely legal and that supporting cultural and indigenous rights is now a widely accepted norm.\n\nFurthermore, Bolivia's decision has sparked a broader discussion about the need for more nuanced approaches to drug policy that take into account the cultural and historical contexts of different countries. Some experts argue that the current international framework is too rigid and fails to accommodate the unique needs and circumstances of various nations. By pushing for an exemption, Bolivia is challenging the status quo and advocating for a more flexible approach that prioritizes cultural sensitivity and human rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over Bolivia's exemption from the 1961 Convention on Drugs is a complex issue that raises important questions about the balance between cultural sensitivity and international drug control policies. As countries continue to navigate this issue, it will be crucial to consider the perspectives of indigenous peoples and prioritize their rights and cultural heritage. Ultimately, the outcome of this debate will have significant implications for global drug policy and our understanding of the complex relationships between culture, identity, and human rights.\n\nMoreover, Bolivia's initiative has also highlighted the need for a more inclusive and culturally sensitive approach to international cooperation on drug control policies. By recognizing the importance of cultural heritage and indigenous rights, countries can work together to develop more effective and sustainable solutions that address the unique challenges faced by different regions and communities. As the debate over Bolivia's exemption continues, it is essential to prioritize dialogue, understanding, and cooperation in order to find a solution that balances cultural sensitivity with international drug control policies.\n\nIn this context, it is worth noting that Bolivia's decision has also sparked a renewed interest in exploring alternative approaches to drug policy that take into account the complex relationships between culture, identity, and human rights.

The exemption allows Bolivia\u2019s indigenous people to chew the leaves.\nBolivia said that the convention was against its new constitution, which says it must \u201cprotect native and ancestral coca\u201d as part of its cultural heritage and says that coca \u201cin its natural state \u2026 is not a dangerous drug\u201d.\nSouth American Indians have chewed coca leaves for hundreds of years.

People who support Bolivia\u2019s position said that defending the rights of indigenous people was the right thing to do. \u201cThe Bolivian move is very important,\u201d said Danny Kushlick, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation. \u201cIt shows that any country that doesn\u2019t want to continue the war on drugs can change its relations with the UN conventions.\u201d\nBut the UN\u2019s International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which checks global drug agreements, says Bolivia may harm international drug controls. Many countries \u2013 including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia \u2013 do not want to give Bolivia what it is asking for.\nThe UK told the UN that it \u201crespects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia\u201d, but it adds: \u201cThe United Kingdom is worried that the exemption could lead to more coca production and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 more coca reaching the cocaine trade. The exemption would make it more difficult to control the illegal drugs trade.\u201d\nThe right of indigenous people in South America\u2019s Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed the convention.\nIn 2011, Bolivia told the UN that it did not want to be part of the convention any more. It is now part of the convention again, but with an exemption so that its indigenous people can continue chewing coca leaves.\nThe exemption is the first in the history of UN drug-control agreements.

The Russian government says that the exemption will lead to more illegal cocaine and warns that \u201cit also sets a dangerous example that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime\u201d.\nThe British parliament has recommended that the UK government should support Bolivia\u2019s request. It says that it is important that countries stay in the convention. Bolivia\u2019s return could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed the convention opposed the exemption. Some people believe that the US and UK are telling other countries that they should block Bolivia\u2019s request.\nNancie Prud\u2019homme, of the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, said people are wrong to oppose Bolivia\u2019s request. \u201cThese objections are not completely legal,\u201d she said. She added that, all over the world, it has become normal to support cultural and indigenous rights, so we should support Bolivia\u2019s efforts.\nThe decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report.

The policy has been credited with a fall in cocaine production in the country, leading some experts to see the Bolivian model as a way forward for other countries.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The international community is embroiled in a contentious debate over Bolivia's bid to protect its native populations' right to engage in ancestral customs such as chewing coca leaves, which has been an integral part of their cultural identity and heritage for centuries and continues to be an essential aspect of their cultural identity. This move has significant implications for global drug policy, as it challenges the conventional wisdom that coca is inherently linked to cocaine production through its cultivation and processing. Bolivia's decision to invoke a special exemption from the 1961 Convention on Drugs, which governs international narcotics control, has sparked concerns among countries such as the UK and Russia, who fear that this could lead to increased coca cultivation and, subsequently, more cocaine reaching the black market.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Bolivia's request is further complicated by its history with the convention. In 1964, during a period of military rule, Bolivia signed the agreement without fully considering the impact on its native populations, which have been subject to marginalization and exclusion from mainstream society for centuries. Now, as it seeks to reassert its cultural identity and promote the rights of its native populations, Bolivia is pushing for an exemption that would allow its people to continue chewing coca leaves in their natural state, which they believe is not inherently dangerous but rather a vital part of their traditional practices.\n\nSupporters of Bolivia's position argue that defending the rights of indigenous peoples is a matter of principle and that this move could set a precedent for other countries to reevaluate their own relationships with the UN conventions. Danny Kushlick, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, has hailed Bolivia's initiative as \"crucially important,\" noting that it demonstrates that any country can reassess its stance on the war on drugs and prioritize cultural sensitivity over strict adherence to international agreements.\n\nHowever, the UN's International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has expressed concerns that Bolivia's exemption could undermine international drug controls. Many countries have echoed these sentiments, with some even suggesting that they may block Bolivia's request if it comes to a vote. The UK, for instance, has stated its reservations about the potential consequences of granting an exemption, citing fears that this could lead to increased coca production and more cocaine reaching the illicit market.\n\nThe Russian government has also weighed in on the issue, warning that Bolivia's move sets a dangerous precedent that could be exploited by other countries seeking to relax their drug control policies. In contrast, some experts have praised Bolivia for its efforts to protect its cultural heritage and promote indigenous rights. Nancie Prud'homme, of the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, has argued that objections to Bolivia's request are not entirely legal and that supporting cultural and indigenous rights is now a widely accepted norm.\n\nFurthermore, Bolivia's decision has sparked a broader discussion about the need for more nuanced approaches to drug policy that take into account the cultural and historical contexts of different countries. Some experts argue that the current international framework is too rigid and fails to accommodate the unique needs and circumstances of various nations. By pushing for an exemption, Bolivia is challenging the status quo and advocating for a more flexible approach that prioritizes cultural sensitivity and human rights.\n\nIn this context, it is worth noting that Bolivia's decision has also sparked a renewed interest in exploring alternative approaches to drug policy that take into account the complex relationships between culture, identity, and human rights. Some experts argue that the current war on drugs has failed to address the root causes of addiction and has instead led to widespread marginalization and exclusion of vulnerable populations. By pushing for an exemption, Bolivia is challenging the status quo and advocating for a more holistic approach that prioritizes public health, human rights, and cultural sensitivity.\n\nIn order to better understand the complexities surrounding this issue, it is essential to examine the historical context in which Bolivia signed the 1961 Convention on Drugs. The country's decision to invoke an exemption from this agreement can be seen as a necessary step towards reasserting its cultural identity and promoting the rights of its native populations. This move has significant implications for global drug policy and our understanding of the complex relationships between culture, identity, and human rights.\n\nMoreover, Bolivia's initiative has also highlighted the need for a more inclusive and culturally sensitive approach to international cooperation on drug control policies. By recognizing the importance of cultural heritage and indigenous rights, countries can work together to develop more effective and sustainable solutions that address the unique challenges faced by different regions and communities. As the debate over Bolivia's exemption continues, it is essential to prioritize dialogue, understanding, and cooperation in order to find a solution that balances cultural sensitivity with international drug control policies.\n\nUltimately, the outcome of this debate will have significant implications for global drug policy and our understanding of the complex relationships between culture, identity, and human rights.

This could have a significant effect on global drugs policy. Bolivia has received a special exemption from the 1961 Convention on Drugs, the agreement that controls international drugs policy. The exemption allows Bolivia\u2019s indigenous people to chew the leaves.\nBolivia said that the convention was against its new constitution, which says it must \u201cprotect native and ancestral coca\u201d as part of its cultural heritage and says that coca \u201cin its natural state \u2026 is not a dangerous drug\u201d.\nSouth American Indians have chewed coca leaves for hundreds of years. The leaves give energy and have medicinal qualities. People who support Bolivia\u2019s position said that defending the rights of indigenous people was the right thing to do. \u201cThe Bolivian move is very important,\u201d said Danny Kushlick, of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation. \u201cIt shows that any country that doesn\u2019t want to continue the war on drugs can change its relations with the UN conventions.\u201d\nBut the UN\u2019s International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which checks global drug agreements, says Bolivia may harm international drug controls. Many countries \u2013 including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia \u2013 do not want to give Bolivia what it is asking for.\nThe UK told the UN that it \u201crespects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia\u201d, but it adds: \u201cThe United Kingdom is worried that the exemption could lead to more coca production and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 more coca reaching the cocaine trade. The exemption would make it more difficult to control the illegal drugs trade.\u201d\nThe right of indigenous people in South America\u2019s Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed the convention.\nIn 2011, Bolivia told the UN that it did not want to be part of the convention any more. It is now part of the convention again, but with an exemption so that its indigenous people can continue chewing coca leaves.\nThe exemption is the first in the history of UN drug-control agreements. It has led to worries that other countries may also ask for exemptions. The Russian government says that the exemption will lead to more illegal cocaine and warns that \u201cit also sets a dangerous example that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime\u201d.\nThe British parliament has recommended that the UK government should support Bolivia\u2019s request. It says that it is important that countries stay in the convention. Bolivia\u2019s return could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed the convention opposed the exemption. Some people believe that the US and UK are telling other countries that they should block Bolivia\u2019s request.\nNancie Prud\u2019homme, of the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, said people are wrong to oppose Bolivia\u2019s request. \u201cThese objections are not completely legal,\u201d she said. She added that, all over the world, it has become normal to support cultural and indigenous rights, so we should support Bolivia\u2019s efforts.\nThe decision to ban coca chewing was based on a 1950 report. Some people say the report did not use any evidence. It is legal to grow coca leaves in Bolivia. As a result, cocaine production has decreased in the country and some experts see Bolivia as a model for other countries.", "human_reference": "\ufeffA major international row with wide-ranging implications for global drugs policy has erupted over the right of Bolivia\u2019s indigenous Indian tribes to chew coca leaves, the principal ingredient in cocaine. Bolivia has obtained a special exemption from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the framework that governs international drugs policy, allowing its indigenous people to chew the leaves.\nBolivia had argued that the convention was in opposition to its new constitution, adopted in 2009, which obliges it to \u201cprotect native and ancestral coca as cultural patrimony\u201d and maintains that coca \u201cin its natural state \u2026 is not a narcotic\u201d.\nSouth American Indians have chewed coca leaves for centuries. The leaves reputedly provide energy and are said to have medicinal qualities. Supporters of Bolivia\u2019s position praised it for standing up for the rights of indigenous people. \u201cThe Bolivian move is inspirational and groundbreaking,\u201d said Danny Kushlick, Head of External Affairs at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, which promotes drug liberalization. \u201cIt shows that any country that has had enough of the war on drugs can change the terms of its engagement with the UN conventions.\u201d\nHowever, the UN\u2019s International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), which monitors implementation of the global drug treaties, has accused Bolivia of threatening the integrity of the international drug control regime. A number of countries \u2013 including the UK, the US, Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Russia \u2013 opposed Bolivia\u2019s demands.\nThe UK\u2019s submission to the UN, which oversees the convention, said that it \u201cacknowledges and respects the cultural importance of the coca leaf in Bolivia\u201d, but it adds: \u201cThe United Kingdom is \u2026 concerned that the reservation could lead to increases in coca production and \u2013 crucially \u2013 the amount of coca diverted to the cocaine trade. As such, the reservation would weaken international law as it relates to the global effort to tackle the drugs trade and could weaken the international community\u2019s response to that trade.\u201d\nThe right of indigenous communities in South America\u2019s Andean region to chew coca leaf was removed in 1964 when Bolivia was under a dictatorship and it signed up to the convention. But, under the terms of the agreement, Bolivia was given 25 years to implement the ban. This expired in 1989 and since then the issue has been under dispute.\nIn 2011, Bolivia \u2013 whose President, Evo Morales, is a former coca producer \u2013 formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the convention. On Friday it reacceded to the convention, but with an exemption from the prohibition on the chewing of coca leaves.\nThe move is the first of its kind in the history of UN drug-control treaties and has sparked concerns that other countries may apply for amendments. The Russian government has argued that the move will lead to \u201can increase in illegal circulation of cocaine\u201d and warned that \u201cit also sets a dangerous precedent that could be used by other states in creating a more liberal drug-control regime\u201d.\nThe British parliament\u2019s Home Affairs Select Committee has recommended that Bolivia\u2019s request should be backed by the UK government, arguing that it was important that countries remained within the single convention. Bolivia\u2019s re-accession could be blocked only if a third or more of the 184 countries that have signed up to the convention opposed its request. There are suspicions that the US and UK are frantically lobbying other countries to gain sufficient numbers to block Bolivia\u2019s request.\nNancie Prud\u2019homme, Projects Director at the International Centre on Human Rights and Drug Policy, criticized the co-ordinated opposition to Bolivia\u2019s demands. \u201cThese objections are legally questionable,\u201d she said. \u201cThey support an arbitrary and over-broad provision and apply international drug laws in a vacuum. This is not appropriate.

The government's assertion that the pay gap is closing is at odds with these numbers, which suggest that full-time male employees still earn 10% more than women, thereby underscoring the imperative for policymakers, business leaders, and stakeholders to work together to create a more equitable workplace for all.\n\nMaria Miller, Minister for Women and Equalities, acknowledged this reality, stating that while changes are underway, there is still much work to be done to achieve true equality in the workplace.

In Brasilia, a smaller rally turned violent as demonstrators breached the high-security perimeter of the national congress, while in Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters attempting to gain entry to a football stadium.\n\nThe protests have been met with a mix of reactions from the government and the public. President Dilma Rousseff has publicly endorsed the right to peaceful protest, stating that it is a natural expression of democracy. However, her words were met with skepticism by many, who pointed out the heavy-handed response of riot police in dispersing protesters. The booing of the president at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup was a stark reminder of the deep-seated discontent that has taken hold among Brazilians.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the government's priorities are starkly at odds with those of the Brazilian people.

Similarly, the lack of investment in education has resulted in a shortage of skilled workers and a brain drain that threatens to undermine Brazil's economic competitiveness.\n\nMoreover, the protests have also shed light on the pervasive corruption that has come to characterize Brazilian society. The astronomical sums allocated for international sporting events, for example, are a stark reminder of the government's priorities and its willingness to sacrifice the needs of the population in favor of flashy infrastructure projects.\n\nAs the protests continue to unfold, it is essential that the government takes concrete steps to address these concerns and work towards building trust with its citizens. This can be achieved through a combination of policy reforms, increased transparency, and genuine engagement with civil society.

Police inside responded with pepper spray and perhaps more \u2013 the Guardian saw one protester passed out and bleeding heavily from a wound in the upper arm.\nThe causes pursued by the protesters varied widely. \u201cWe are here because we hate the government. They do nothing for us,\u201d said Oscar Jos\u00e9 Santos, a 19 year old who was with a group of hooded youths from the Rocinha favela.\n\u201cI\u2019m an architect but I have been unemployed for six months. There must be something wrong with this country,\u201d said Nadia al Husin, holding up a banner calling on the government to do more for education.\nAt a far smaller rally in Brasilia, demonstrators broke through police lines to enter the high-security area of the national congress. Several climbed onto the roof.\nIn Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters who tried to break through a cordon around a football stadium hosting a Confederations Cup match between Nigeria and Tahiti.\nIn Porto Alegre, demonstrators set fire to a bus and, in Curitiba, protesters attempted to force their way into the office of the state governor. There were also rallies in Belem, Salvador and elsewhere.\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, which had seen the fiercest clashes the previous week and the main allegations of police violence, large crowds gathered once again but initial reports suggested the marches passed peacefully.\nReflecting the importance of social networks in spreading the message about the protests, some in S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 where numbers were estimated at between 30,000 and 100,000 \u2013 carried banners declaring \u201cWe come from Facebook\u201d.\nMost protesters were young and, for many, it was their first experience of such a giant rally. \u201cMy generation has never experienced this,\u201d said Thiago Firbida, a student. \u201cSince the dictatorship, Brazilians never bothered to take over the streets. They did not believe they had a reason to. But now Brazil is once again in crisis, with a constant rise in prices, so people are finally reacting.\u201d\nComparisons have been drawn with rallies in Turkey and elsewhere. Another global link was evident in the handful of demonstrators who wore Guy Fawkes masks, associated with Anonymous and the Occupy Wall Street protests.\nBrazil\u2019s demonstrations are being referred to as the \u201cvinegar revolution\u201d (after police arrested people for carrying vinegar to counter tear gas), as well as the \u201c20-cent revolution\u201d (due to the bus price rise) and the Passe Livre (after the demand for free public transport).\nSome said the protests felt un-Brazilian but liberating. \u201cOur politicians need to see the strength we have as one people. Brazilians tend to be too nice sometimes \u2013 they enjoy partying rather than protesting \u2013 but something is changing,\u201d said Deli Borsari, a 53-year-old yoga instructor.\nFollowing widespread news coverage of the costs of new and refurbished stadiums, the Confederations Cup football tournament has been one of the focuses of the protests. Before the opening match in Brasilia, crowds of demonstrators were dispersed by riot police. Footage showed frightened Japanese supporters rushing from the area holding their children, as the sound of shots \u2013 perhaps rubber bullets or tear gas \u2013 was heard.\nAnother protest march, near Rio\u2019s Maracana Stadium, was met with a similarly heavy police response.\nMost of the rallies appeared to start peacefully until they confronted the security forces, who are largely organized at a regional level. President Dilma Rousseff condones the protests, according to her aides. \u201cThe president believes peaceful protests are legitimate and proper for a democracy, and that it is natural for young people to demonstrate,\u201d said Helena Chagas of the president\u2019s office.\nHowever, the president was booed at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup. With the economy in bad shape and social unrest on the rise, she faces a serious political challenge, both now and in 2014, when Brazil will not only host the World Cup but also have a presidential election.", "complexification_output": {"rewritten_text": "The widespread discontent among Brazilians has culminated in a plethora of protests, with over 100,000 individuals taking to the streets to express their indignation towards the government's handling of public services and the exorbitantly high costs associated with hosting the World Cup. The demonstrations, which commenced peacefully in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasilia, Belem, Belo Horizonte, and Salvador, soon turned confrontational as protesters clashed with police, resulting in the destruction of property and injuries to several law enforcement officials.\n\nThe grievances of the protesters are multifaceted, encompassing not only the woefully inadequate quality of public services but also the shockingly subpar sums allocated for international sporting events, the abysmally low standards of healthcare, and the pervasive corruption that has come to characterize Brazilian society. The Confederations Cup, which kicked off amidst these protests, has become a lightning rod for discontent, with many viewing it as a symbol of the government's priorities.\n\nAs one protester succinctly put it, \"We are here because we hate the government. They do nothing for us.\" This sentiment was echoed by others, who expressed their frustration with the lack of opportunities and the sense of disillusionment that has taken hold among Brazil's youth. In Brasilia, a smaller rally turned violent as demonstrators breached the high-security perimeter of the national congress, while in Belo Horizonte, police clashed with protesters attempting to gain entry to a football stadium.\n\nThe protests have been met with a mix of reactions from the government and the public. President Dilma Rousseff has publicly endorsed the right to peaceful protest, stating that it is a natural expression of democracy. However, her words were met with skepticism by many, who pointed out the heavy-handed response of riot police in dispersing protesters. The booing of the president at the opening ceremony for the Confederations Cup was a stark reminder of the deep-seated discontent that has taken hold among Brazilians.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that the government's priorities are starkly at odds with those of the Brazilian people. While the government continues to allocate vast sums towards international sporting events, the needs of the population remain unaddressed. The lack of investment in public services and infrastructure has resulted in a woefully inadequate quality of life for many Brazilians.\n\nAs the protests continue to unfold, it remains to be seen whether they will lead to meaningful reforms or simply serve as a catalyst for further unrest. One thing is certain, however: the Brazilian people have finally found their voice, and it will not be silenced. The government would do well to take heed of the protesters' demands and work towards addressing the systemic issues that have led to this crisis.\n\nIn fact, the protests have highlighted a number of pressing concerns that require immediate attention from the government. The woefully inadequate state of public transportation, for instance, has left many commuters stranded for hours on end. Similarly, the lack of investment in education has resulted in a shortage of skilled workers and a brain drain that threatens to undermine Brazil's economic competitiveness.\n\nMoreover, the protests have also shed light on the pervasive corruption that has come to characterize Brazilian society. The astronomical sums allocated for international sporting events, for example, are a stark reminder of the government's priorities and its willingness to sacrifice the needs of the population in favor of flashy infrastructure projects.\n\nAs the protests continue to unfold, it is essential that the government takes concrete steps to address these concerns and work towards building trust with its citizens. This can be achieved through a combination of policy reforms, increased transparency, and genuine engagement with civil society. Only by doing so can the government hope to restore stability to the country and ensure that the Brazilian people's voices are heard.\n\nIn order to effectively address the systemic issues plaguing Brazil, it is crucial that the government adopts a multifaceted approach. This should involve not only policy reforms but also increased transparency and genuine engagement with civil society. By doing so, the government can regain the trust of its citizens and restore stability to the country.\n\nFurthermore, the government must prioritize the needs of the population over flashy infrastructure projects. This means investing in public services and infrastructure, rather than allocating vast sums towards international sporting events. Only by doing so can the government hope to improve the quality of life for many Brazilians.\n\nIn conclusion, the protests in Brazil have highlighted a number of pressing concerns that require immediate attention from the government. Through genuine reform and a commitment to addressing the systemic issues that have led to this crisis, the government can regain the trust of its citizens and restore stability to the country. The Brazilian people have finally found their voice, and it is time for the government to listen.\n\nThe protests have also underscored the need for the government to prioritize transparency and accountability.

Scientists now think this will not happen, but average land and sea temperatures will probably continue rising during this century, possibly becoming 4 \u00b0C hotter than now. That rise would ruin crops and make life in many cities too hot.\nAs temperatures rise and oceans become warmer, there will be big changes in annual rainfall in tropical and subtropical regions, says the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, released in Stockholm and published online in September 2013.\nEast Africa can expect more short rainfalls and west Africa should expect heavier monsoons. Burma, Bangladesh and India can expect stronger cyclones; elsewhere in southern Asia, there will probably be heavier summer rainfalls. Indonesia may receive less rainfall between July and October, but the coastal regions around the south China Sea and Gulf of Thailand can expect more rainfall when cyclones hit the land. 'Rainfall patterns will change. Northern countries, for example in Europe or North America, will probably receive more rainfall, but many subtropical, dry regions will likely get less rain,' said the report.\nThe report also said that the monsoon season will probably start earlier and last longer.\nScientists in developing countries are happy with the report. \u201cThe IPCC says that climate change is real and happening much more strongly than before. We are already seeing the effects of climate change in Bangladesh and across south Asia. It\u2019s not news to us.\nMost developing countries are experiencing climate change now. They do not need the IPCC to tell them that the weather is changing,\u201d said Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development.\nScientists have also lowered their predictions for sea-level rises. Sea levels will probably rise an average of 40 \u201362 cm by 2100. But many millions of people living in the developing world\u2019s great cities, including Lagos and Calcutta, are in danger.\nWeather disasters are also more likely in a warmer world, the report says.

As the report's authors note, \"A hot world is a hungry world.\" Furthermore, the IPCC's findings highlight the urgent need for climate action and sustainable development in vulnerable regions, where communities are already struggling to cope with the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn light of these projections, it is imperative that policymakers and stakeholders prioritize climate-resilient agriculture, water management, and disaster risk reduction strategies. This will require significant investments in research and development, as well as capacity-building initiatives for developing countries. By taking proactive measures to address the root causes of climate change, we can mitigate its disastrous effects on vulnerable populations and ensure a more equitable and sustainable future.\n\nIn this context, it is essential to recognize that climate change is not only an environmental issue but also a social justice concern. The disproportionate impact of climate change on poorer countries underscores the need for a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. By addressing the underlying drivers of poverty and inequality, we can create a more just and sustainable world where all individuals have access to the resources they need to thrive.\n\nFurthermore, the IPCC's findings emphasize the importance of international cooperation and knowledge-sharing in addressing climate change. Developing countries must be supported in their efforts to develop climate-resilient infrastructure, technologies, and policies. This will require significant investments in capacity-building initiatives, technology transfer, and South-South cooperation.\n\nIn conclusion, the IPCC's report highlights the urgent need for climate action and sustainable development in vulnerable regions. By prioritizing climate-resilient agriculture, water management, and disaster risk reduction strategies, we can mitigate the devastating effects of climate change on poorer countries and ensure a more equitable and sustainable future. Moreover, it is crucial to acknowledge that climate change is not only an environmental issue but also a moral imperative, requiring collective action from governments, civil society, and individuals worldwide to address its root causes and mitigate its impacts on vulnerable populations.\n\nIn this regard, the concept of climate justice becomes increasingly relevant, emphasizing the need for a more equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, and burdens in addressing climate change. By promoting climate justice, we can create a more just and sustainable world where all individuals have access to the resources they need to thrive, regardless of their geographical location or socio-economic status.\n\nFurthermore, the IPCC's findings underscore the importance of climate-resilient infrastructure, technologies, and policies in vulnerable regions. Developing countries must be supported in their efforts to develop climate-resilient agriculture, water management, and disaster risk reduction strategies. This will require significant investments in capacity-building initiatives, technology transfer, and South-South cooperation.\n\nIn light of these projections, it is imperative that policymakers and stakeholders prioritize climate action and sustainable development in vulnerable regions.

The decline of coal consumption in the US has helped to cut prices for coal globally. This has made it more attractive, even in Europe where coal use was supposed to be discouraged by the Emissions Trading Scheme.\nMaria van der Hoeven, Executive Director of the IEA, said: \u201cCoal\u2019s share of the global energy mix continues to grow each year and, if no changes are made to current policies, coal will catch oil within a decade.\u201d\nCoal is abundant and found in most regions of the world, unlike conventional oil and gas, and can be cheaply extracted. As a result, coal was used to meet nearly half of the rise in demand for energy globally in the past decade. According to the IEA, demand from China and India will drive world coal use in the coming five years, with India likely to overtake the US as the world\u2019s second biggest consumer. China is the biggest coal importer, and Indonesia the biggest exporter, having temporarily overtaken Australia.\nAccording to the IEA\u2019s Medium-Term Coal Market Report the world will burn 1.2bn more tonnes of coal per year by 2017 compared with today \u2013 the equivalent of the current coal consumption of Russia and the US combined. Global coal consumption is forecast to reach 4.3bn tonnes of oil equivalent by 2017, while oil consumption is forecast to reach 4.4bn tonnes by the same date.\nWith the highest carbon emissions of any major fossil fuel, coal is a huge contributor to climate change, particularly when burned in old-fashioned, inefficient power stations. When these are not equipped with special \u201cscrubbing\u201d equipment to remove chemicals, coal can also produce sulphur emissions \u2013 the leading cause of acid rain \u2013 and other pollutants such as mercury and soot particles.\nVan der Hoeven said that, without a high carbon price to discourage the growth in coal use and encourage cleaner technologies such as renewable power generation, only competition from lower-priced gas could realistically cut demand for coal. This has happened in the US, owing to the extraordinary increase in the production of shale gas in that market in the past five years.\nShe said: \u201cThe US experience suggests that a more efficient gas market, marked by flexible pricing and fuelled by indigenous unconventional resources that are produced sustainably, can reduce coal use, carbon dioxide emissions and consumers\u2019 electricity bills. Europe, China and other regions should take note.\u201d\nThat would mean producing much more shale gas, as conventional gas resources are running down in their easily accessible locations.\nIn Europe, the Emissions Trading Scheme was supposed to discourage high-carbon power generation by imposing a price on carbon dioxide emissions. This was done through issuing generators and energy-intensive companies with a set quota of emissions permits, requiring them to buy extra permits if they needed to emit more than their allowance. But an over-allocation, coupled with the effects of the financial crisis and recession, has led to a large surplus of permits on the market, which has in turn led to a plunge in permit prices. At current levels \u2013 a few euros per tonne of carbon \u2013 there is little incentive to seek out lower carbon fuels, and coal is enjoying a renaissance in Europe.\nThat means one of the world\u2019s only regulatory market mechanisms aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions is failing in its key goals.

Furthermore, she emphasizes the need for governments to implement policies that promote the development of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power, which can provide a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to coal.\n\nIn order to mitigate the effects of this trend, it is essential that governments, industries, and civil society work together to develop and implement policies that promote the transition to cleaner energy sources and reduce our reliance on coal. This can be achieved through a combination of measures, including increasing investment in renewable energy technologies, improving energy efficiency standards, and implementing carbon pricing mechanisms.\n\nMoreover, it is crucial that policymakers recognize the importance of addressing the root causes of this trend, rather than simply treating its symptoms. This requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the social, economic, and environmental implications of our energy choices. By working together to develop a more sustainable energy future, we can ensure a cleaner, healthier, and more prosperous world for generations to come.\n\nIf left unaddressed, this trend will undoubtedly lead to further climate change, underscoring the urgent need for decisive action to mitigate its effects. Therefore, it is imperative that governments, industries, and civil society work together to develop and implement policies that promote the transition to cleaner energy sources and reduce our reliance on coal, thereby ensuring a more sustainable future for generations to come.\n\nIn conclusion, the escalating demand for coal as a global energy source poses a significant threat to the environment and public health. It is essential that policymakers take immediate action to address this trend and promote the transition to cleaner energy sources. By working together, we can ensure a more sustainable future for generations to come, thereby safeguarding our planet's ecological integrity and ensuring a healthier, more prosperous world for all.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge the interconnectedness of global energy demand, climate change mitigation, and ecological sustainability. The transition to cleaner energy sources requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and environmental implications of our energy choices.
